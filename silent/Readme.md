# Module: Silent

![](/silent/viewme.png)

## Name

[`MDL-echomods_emulator`]()

## Title

This is the module which emulates the signal coming from the analog processing chain.

## Description

* Teensy for its DAC.
* version: V0.1
* date: 26/07/2016
* cost:35$
* sourcing:Get from [Adafruit](https://www.adafruit.com/products/3056)
* technology: Adafruit Feather
* language: C
* author: Kelu124

## IOs

### Inputs

* `ITF-A_gnd`
* `ITF-B_5v`
* `ITF-J_pulse_off`

### Outputs

* `ITF-R_reserved` which is a raw signal

## Key Components

* `Feather WICED`

## Information

### What is it supposed to do?

The aim of this echOmod is to simulate a raw signal that would come from the piezo and analog chain.

### How does it work: block diagram

![Block schema](/silent/source/blocks.png)

* `ITF-B_5v`->`Feather WICED`->`DAC`->`Biais removal`->`ITF-R_reserved`
* `ITF-J_pulse_off`->`5V to 3.3V`->`B5`->`Feather WICED`

## About the module

### Pros

* TBD

### Cons

* TBD

## Constraint and limits

#### Getting a signal 

With a simple code on feather WICED, managed to get a 1.8 - 2Mhz signal ( [code is here](/silent/software/featherWICED/SimpleSignalGenerator.ino) ).

#### Look of the module

The pins needed to be rerouted, so an intermediary board was made ouf of stripboard

The interrupt was brought done to 3.3V instead of the 5V coming from the trinket pro, routed to pin B5.

#### Result with Goblin, the analog processing

##### Signal out of DAC

#### Why not a Feather WICED ?

* [Fading](https://github.com/adafruit/Adafruit_WICED_Arduino/blob/master/examples/Hardware/PWM/Fading/Fading.ino) as well 
* IT has two DACs : see [here](https://cdn-learn.adafruit.com/assets/assets/000/031/391/medium800/adafruit_products_WICEDPinout.jpg?1458753854) 

##### Interrupts:

If similar to the Feather M0Proto

* `#0 / RX - GPIO #0`, also receive (input) pin for Serial1 and Interrupt 2
* `#1 / TX - GPIO #1`, also transmit (output) pin for Serial1 and Interrupt 3
* `#2 / SDA - GPIO #2`, also the I2C (Wire) data pin. There's no pull up on this pin by default so when using with I2C, you may need a 2.2K-10K pullup. Also Interrupt #1
* `#3 / SCL - GPIO #3`, also the I2C (Wire) clock pin. There's no pull up on this pin by default so when using with I2C, you may need a 2.2K-10K pullup. Can also do PWM output and act as Interrupt 0.

### Why not a Teensy ?

Simplement (TEENSY) pour Ã©muler un signal. A "high" speed DAC is required. Since the acquisition period is 200us, we should have say 2 periods over this, hence a period of 100us, that's a 10kHz signal we should see. At 20 pts per period, we should have roughly a 200kHz DAC.

## Discussions

### TODO

### DONE

* Feather: [work with an interrupt](/silent/software/featherWICED/SignalGenerator/SignalGenerator.ino)
* Write code for feather WICED
* Publish this code
* Remove Signal Bias
* Validated with a Feather WICED ([code](/silent/software/featherWICED/SimpleSignalGenerator.ino)).
* Feather: remove the average value before inputing in Goblin
* [Check output with Goblin](/silent/2016-08-09-SilentPlusTobo.md)
