# `20190713a` and `20190713b`

Running tests on the new un0rick batch - running on both RPi W and Pi 4.

It seems there are library adjustments to be done on the Pi4 - it seems that only half of the points are captured on the Pi 4. However, the board seems OK as it works OK with the Pi W.

## Tests with the Pi 4.. and Python 3
