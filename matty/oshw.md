## Intro

This form is designed to guide you though the certification license agreement.  Note that THIS GUIDE IS NOT A SUBSTITUTE FOR THE LICENSE AGREEMENT ITSELF.  When you sign up for certification you are agreeing to be bound by the license agreement, which you should read and is available at https://sites.google.com/site/oshwatest/home/license-agreement.  While this checklist covers  many of the elements in the license agreement, you should not rely on it to cover all aspects of the license agreement in depth.  Any discrepancies between this form and the license agreement will be resolved in favor of the license agreement.
