# Implementing HV source. 

## Constraints

* Small footprint
* Settable
* Between 0 to 90V, ideally with another source for 0 to -90V (for bipolar pulses)

## Options

### MAX668

Maxim has this 150V reference design based on MAX668 that can be controlled via DAC:

### MIC3172

Also, Microchip has this other reference design based on MIC3172 that also can be easily modified to add a DAC into FB path.

### LT3494 - used in the pHAT

* +DAC for setup. Up to 39V.

### NMT0572SC - used in the un0rick board

* 24, 48, 72V lines

### max15031

The MAX15031 consists of a constant-frequency pulse-width modulating (PWM) step-up DC-DC converter with an internal switch and a high-side current monitor with high-speed adjustable current limiting. This device can generate output voltages up to 76V and provides current monitoring up to 4mA (up to 300mW). 

 Internal soft-start circuitry limits the input current when the boost converter starts. The MAX15031 features a shutdown mode to save power.

The MAX15031 includes a current monitor with more than three decades of dynamic range and monitors current ranging from 500nA to 4mA with high accuracy. Resistor-adjustable current limiting protects the APD from optical power transients. A clamp diode protects the monitor's output from overvoltage conditions. Other protection features include cycle-by-cycle current limiting of the boost converter switch, undervoltage lockout, and thermal shutdown if the die temperature reaches +160Â°C.
