# `20201031a` Finding the best pulse - echo delay.

The objective is to find the best pulse pattern for this.

Here, we have Pon ~ 16 at best. No matter was the other is.

Well ! That's 16/128 ~ 8MHz, the double of the piezo (around 3.5 to 4MHz), so no surprise here. POn corresponds to half a wave for the piezo.
