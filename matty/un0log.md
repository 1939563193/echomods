### 2018-01-26 -- The clock had to be removed!

Investigation showed no connection through USB.. a ftdi issue. Powers were OK.. but still nothing.

So what? __Clock!!__

I unfortunately destroyed the 12MHz clock.. well that's it =) I'll be waiting for the new one from digikey.

The clock has to be rotated by 90Â°

This has reached a couple of days ago =)

Looks good - ice40 and ram look good. The high-level pulser footprint seems reversed. The 3.3V is on, 5V level looks good, seems good!
