# `20201103a` impedance matching tests

## Setup

Using 0.6 to 1.7uH inductance. C is a 70pF variable one. 
Interestingly, U and L are in parallel, not what is suggested in litterature.

`2*pi*F= 1/sqrt(L*C)` says we're at ~17 to 20MHz freq. We would need to double L to get to 10MHz.

## Adaptation impact on impedance

We gain a deeper peak at resonance.
