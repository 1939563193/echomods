# Winning value proposition

__Growing plan for 2019__

## SWOT

### Objectives

* Improve quality of product (HV, verilog, look & feel)
* Reduce number of SKU
* Increase sales
* Finalize a boilerplate for ICE40 icestorm
* Increase contributors :) (vanity)
  * have people push code 
  * have people share designs and ideas
* Enhance forkability of project (another wmeng this year?)

### SWOT

* __Strength__ 
  * Open-source
  * Simple designs
  * using python for RPi
  * compatible with any MCU, including m5stack
* __Weakness__
  * I'm not an EE
  * Limited resources (time, money)
  * One channel board only
  * Retiring products
  * HV component
  * Products somehow tough to set up
  * Unknown market / insufficient market research
* __Opportunity__
  * The ICE40 movement  
  * Appreciable market (researchers, makers, students, professional NDT, ...)
  * NDT movement (O&G, Bilbao, ...)
  * Students : research platform
  * Companies wanting to explore the field
  * MEMs are opening
* __Threats__
  * Trolls
  * Copycats
  * fpga still scares

### Strategies

* __Attack__
  * Increase communication: blog posts, ice40 community, raspberry community, ...
  * Transform buyers in contributors
  * Propose m5stack partnership
  * Crowdfund campaign : raises awareness and sells
  * Boost NDT activities (includes tapping NDT community, twice already, plus getting some dedicated hardware)
* __Dare__:
  * Develop a ad-hoc extension board (eg MUX) for the series - boosting to 8 channels to test? Get a 8-channel piezo.
  * Recruit ICE40 contributors 
  * Boost HV modules: develop extensions for boards (and why not on un0rick itself? 40V+doubling+new pulser to replace  - use sterling HV designs ? Use these 180V modules ? )
  * BD: identify prospective clients, list old ones : CRM (buyers, curious, experts, champions..) ?
  * Improve documentation for un0/lit3
  * Reduce time to first acquisition
* __Crush__
  * Create OSHWA certification
  * Preempt: Communicate early 
* __Defend__
  * Community to self-maintain and defend: need to increase community
  * Let copycats get the older designs
  * be open about project shortcomings
  * do not speak about fpga ?
