# Testing the PCB

May 22nd 2017: I've just got the new boards, and was willing to test those with the real stuff!

Made one mistake (or maybe not one, depends how one looks at it): the GPIO23 and GPIO24 are used to control the pulser -- but they are also used in getting ADCs signal on the "old". I just removed the issue by putting the PulseOff on GPIO21, and pulsing Off on GPIO21, and by removing the jumpers between Pon/Pon3 and Poff/Poff3.

I tested the oled connection with [this procedure](https://blog.jokielowie.com/en/2016/03/wyswietlacz-oled-ssd1306-i-raspberry-pi/). It seems to work.

I don't need the power supply on with my laptop powering the Pi and the rest of the board. All seems OK, and capture is fine as well.

--> "Just" need to develop the API =)

## What does the ADC hat yield?

## As a reminder.. the original signal (before amp) is

(yellow is out of the microcontroler emulator -- and blue is out of the enveloppe detector - which is what is being acquired at this level)

Can't power the pulser along with USB power. When powered, I'm removing the 3.3V jumper

Actually, the power supply was at fault. When connecting with a 750mA 5V power supply, I can get all correctly, with the 3.3V jumper put on if not power supply, or without (or with) the 3.3V jumper but with the [power regulator](/retired/mogaba/).
