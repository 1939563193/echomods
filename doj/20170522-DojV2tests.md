# Testing the PCB

May 22nd 2017: I've just got the new boards, and was willing to test those with the real stuff!

Made one mistake (or maybe not one, depends how one looks at it): the GPIO23 and GPIO24 are used to control the pulser -- but they are also used in getting ADCs signal on the "old". I just removed the issue by putting the PulseOff on GPIO21, and pulsing Off on GPIO21, and by removing the jumpers between Pon/Pon3 and Poff/Poff3.

I tested the oled connection with [this procedure](https://blog.jokielowie.com/en/2016/03/wyswietlacz-oled-ssd1306-i-raspberry-pi/). It seems to work.

I don't need the power supply on with my laptop powering the Pi and the rest of the board. All seems OK, and capture is fine as well.

--> "Just" need to develop the API =)

## As a reminder.. the original signal (before amp) is
