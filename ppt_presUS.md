## Objective

The objective of this project is to propose an open-source, low-cost dev-kit ultrasound imaging  to allow scientists, academics, hackers, makers or OSHW fans to hack their way to ultrasound imaging.

## What tech approach ?

* Going back to the time when ultrasound was all mechanical.
* Having a modular "approach"

## Cost of the set: 325$

* A probe on ebay: 75$
* High voltage module: 80$ of components
* Analog processing module: 80$ of components
* PCBs: 40$
* ADC Pi Hat: 40$ 
* Pi: 10$

## Lessons

* _Acquisition_
* _Documentation_
* _Doing and sharing_


## Acquisition

Build the tools you need..

* BeagleBone DAQ
* BitScope
* STM32 (Feather WICED)
* ... __custom made__!

## Documentation

Documentation here is key. A website that builds itself based on proper, simple and un-redondant information is needed... and this repo / presentation is a proof it's on the way ;)

## Doing and sharing

* Documentation on GitHub
* "Blogging" on Hackaday
* A summary on Journal of Open Hardware (thanks GOSH!)
* Tindie for sharing "extra" boards

## Pending issues

* Certification
* Sensors sourcing

## We can discuss how

* to do a working dev-kit
* implement and efficient (err, lazy) way of documenting. 
* share with a community
* better understand your "product"
