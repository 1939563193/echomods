### Notes
 
#### 1st Proposal

Attached is drawing for one of the transducers we make with UHF connector.
Will those outside dimensions work for you? We can change connector to BNC or Microdot or just provide it without any connector just wires.
In it we could make:

* 3.5MHz, 0.5” diameter with 3” Spherical Focus,     $277.0each
* 5.0MHz, 0.5” diameter with 3” Spherical Focus,     $277.0each
* 7.5MHz, 0.5” diameter with 3” Spherical Focus,     $320.0each
