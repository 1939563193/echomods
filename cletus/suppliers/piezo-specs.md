* One at 3.5 MHz, focal zone between 50 and 150 mm,
* One at 5 MHz , focal zone between 30 and 105 mm,
* One at 7.5 MHz , focal zone between 10 and 75 mm.

With respect to the dimensions, we would need:

* Diameter: as small as possible, ideally below 15mm for the 3.5MHz, 8mm for the 5MHz and 5mm for the 7.5MHz - without casing.
* Thickness: as small as possible.
