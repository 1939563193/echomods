<h1>Why a CLA ? 1/2</h1>
<p><em>&quot;A Contributor Licence Agreement (CLA) is strongly recommended when accepting third party contributions to an open development project, such as an open source software project. In order to redistribute contributions, it is necessary to ensure that the project has the necessary rights to do so. A Contributor Licence Agreement is a lightweight agreement, signed by the copyright holder, that grants the necessary rights for the contribution to be redistributed as part of the project.&quot;</em> <a href="http://oss-watch.ac.uk/resources/cla">OSS Watch</a></p>
</section><section id="why-a-cla-22" class="slide level2">
<h1>Why a CLA? 2/2</h1>
<p>A CLA is a legal document in which you state <em>you are entitled to contribute the code/documentation/translation to the project</em> you’re contributing to and that <em>you are willing to have it used in distributions and derivative works</em>. This means that should there be any kind of legal issue in the future as to the origins and ownership of any particular piece of code, then that project has the necessary forms on file from the contributor(s) saying they were permitted to make this contribution.</p>
</section><section id="cla-is-a-safety-bis" class="slide level2">
<h1>CLA is a safety (bis)</h1>
<p>Moreover, the CLA also ensures that once you have provided a contribution, you cannot try to withdraw permission for its use at a later date. People and companies can therefore use that software, confident that they will not be asked to stop using pieces of the code at a later date.</p>
</section><section id="inputs-outputs" class="slide level2">
<h1>Inputs / outputs</h1>
<p>A <strong>license</strong> grants &quot;outbound&quot; rights to the user of project.</p>
<p>A <strong>CLA</strong> enables a contributor to grant &quot;inbound&quot; rights to a project.</p>
</section><section id="cla-and-licenses" class="slide level2">
<h1>CLA and Licenses ?</h1>
<p>A CLA is <em>inbound</em>, when a License is <em>outbound</em>.</p>
<p><em>Ideally, <strong>inbound=outbound</strong>: the contributor give the same rights to the project that the project gives to the user.</em> By default, if the contract does not define who will own the property, it is more likely than not that the person who wrote it will own it.</p>
</section><section id="pi" class="slide level2">
<h1>PI</h1>
<p>Two big families:</p>
<ul>
<li>Contributor License Agreement (CLA), the original contributor retains copyright ownership of their contributions, but grants the project a broad set of rights such that the project can incorporate and distribute the contributions as it needs to.</li>
<li><p>a Copyright Assignment Agreement (CAA), the contributor actually transfers copyright ownership of the contributions to the project, who can then license it however they want since they own it</p></li>
<li>can assign the copyright in all contributions to the project owner;</li>
<li><p>can grant an irrevocable licence to allow the project maintainer to use the contribution.</p></li>
</ul>
</section><section id="why-granting-an-irrevocable-license" class="slide level2">
<h1>Why granting an irrevocable license?</h1>
<ul>
<li>Sustainable for the project</li>
<li>Allows the contributor to use his/her contribution on other projects, especially true for general-use contribution</li>
<li>the project recognizes the work of a pro-bono contributor compared to paid-for service-providers</li>
</ul>
</section><section id="concrete-example" class="slide level2">
<h1>Concrete example</h1>
<p>Can I reuse a contribution to an open-source project on another project? <em>Well... it depends.. on the CLA</em></p>
<ul>
<li>If the contributor keeps his/her copyright, and grants the project an irrevocable license to use his contribution, the contributor can share this contribution with other projects.</li>
<li>If the contributor assignts the copyright to the project, s.he may not be able to reuse this on other projects.</li>
</ul>
</section><section id="examples-of-cla" class="slide level2">
<h1>Examples of CLA</h1>
</section><section id="canonical-typical-cla" class="slide level2">
<h1>Canonical typical CLA</h1>
<p>As of August 2011, Canonical is requesting contributions be licensed under a Harmony Contribution Licence Agreement, rather than the copyright being assigned to Canonical. With the Harmony CLA, <em>&quot;the contributor gives Canonical a licence to use their contributions. The contributor continues to own the copyright in the contribution, with full rights to re-use, re-distribute, and continue modifying the contributed code, allowing them to also share that contribution with other projects.&quot;</em></p>
</section><section id="apache-cla" class="slide level2">
<h1>Apache CLA</h1>
<p>All contributors of ideas, code, or documentation to any Apache projects <em>complete, sign, and submit (via fax or email) an Individual Contributor License Agreement (ICLA)</em>. <strong>The purpose of this agreement is to clearly define the terms under which intellectual property has been contributed to the Project and thereby allow us to defend the project should there be a legal dispute regarding the software at some future time</strong>. <em>A signed ICLA is required to be on file before an individual is given commit rights to a project</em>.</p>
<p>Apache CLA : <a href="https://www.apache.org/licenses/icla.txt">see here</a></p>
</section><section id="why-not-a-cla" class="slide level2">
<h1>Why not a CLA ?</h1>
<p>CLAs twist the empowering, community-oriented, enjoyable experience of FLOSS contribution into an annoying exercise in pointless bureaucracy, which (if handled properly) requires a business-like, grating haggle between necessarily adverse parties.</p>
</section><section id="simpler" class="slide level2">
<h1>Simpler?</h1>
<p>Most projects use the same time-honored and successful mechanism used throughout the 35 year history of the Free Software community: submissions using the normal means to contribute to the project — such as patches to the mailing list or pull and merge requests — indicate the contributors' assent for inclusion of that Contribution in the canonical version under the project's license.</p>
</section><section id="is-a-copyright-transfer-necessary" class="slide level2">
<h1>Is a copyright transfer necessary?</h1>
<p><em>No</em>. A license to <em>to make, use, sell, offer for sale, import and otherwise run, modify and propagate the contribution</em> is enough to grant the recipients the essentials rights to use the contribution.</p>
</section><section id="what-link-with-echopens-license" class="slide level2">
<h1>What link with echOpen's license</h1>
<p><strong>11. Patents.</strong></p>
<p><em>Each contributor grants you a non-exclusive, worldwide, royalty-free patent license under the contributor's essential patent claims, to make, use, sell, offer for sale, import and otherwise run, modify and propagate the contents of its contributor version.</em></p>
<p>It means that IP remains the Contributor by default.</p>
</section><section id="which-contributors" class="slide level2">
<h1>Which contributors?</h1>
<p>Different use-cases:</p>
<ul>
<li>paid: employees, contractors, ..</li>
<li>unpaid: individual contributors, researchers, teachers, doctors</li>
<li>unclear: partners, organizations, trainees, ...</li>
</ul>
</section><section id="an-example-a-public-research-group" class="slide level2">
<h1>An example: a public research group</h1>
<p>A public lab contributes to a project. It is paid by public fund.</p>
<p>Can it assign the copyright of his/her contribution to a third party?</p>
</section><section id="often.." class="slide level2">
<h1>Often..</h1>
<p>Recognize the pro-bono contributions by leaving the author's copyright (but him/her granting a license to the project), to distinguish this contribution from paid-for contribution:</p>
<ul>
<li>Paid contributors give their copyright, but the project can allow the paid contributors to keep their copyrights</li>
<li>Unpaid contributors grant a a licence to use their contributions by default, unless they want to assign the copyright to the project.</li>
</ul>
</section><section id="application-to-the-murgen-modules-project" class="slide level2">
<h1>Application to the murgen-modules project</h1>
<p>Suggestion:</p>
<ul>
<li>Establishing a Canonical (IP-neutral) CLA</li>
<li>Submitting the work as part of the <em>medico-technical</em></li>
<li>Add a contribution to echopen's board :)</li>
</ul>
</section><section id="questions-to-jurist" class="slide level2">
<h1>Questions to jurist:</h1>
<ul>
<li>What is different between assigning copyrights to the project, and granting the <em>non-exclusive, worldwide, royalty-free patent license</em> ?</li>
<li>A public lab contributes to a project. It is paid by public fund. Can it assign the copyright of his/her contribution to a third party?</li>
<li>Is it necessary to have same CLAs for all types of contributors?</li>
