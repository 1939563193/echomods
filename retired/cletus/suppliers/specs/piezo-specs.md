## Q&A

### Q

1. How are you defining your focal zone:  - 6 dB pressure, or -6 dB pressure squared? 

Olympus NDT and others define this by -6 dB pressure, but the therapeutic IEC standard defines this by -6 dB pressure squared. If youâ€™re using -6 dB pressure, here is what I would suggest:

    - 3.5 MHz x 15 mm diameter x 100 mm radius.  This reaches 47 to 148 mm, assuming free field modeling. 
    - 5.0 MHz x 10 mm diameter x 65 mm radius.  This reaches 30 to 98 mm, assuming free field modeling.
    - 7.5 MHz x 4 mm diameter x unfocused (flat).  This reaches 13 to 61 mm, assuming free field modeling. 

2. What are you bandwidth and sensitivity requirements? 
3. Will you require a matching network for each transducer to sustain sensitivity over the bandwidth?
4. What cable length do you require (wire length for both ground and signal)? 
5. Do you have any biocompatibility or sterilization requirements? 
6. Will this need to pass a hi-pot specification? 

### and A

1. Better with pressure square
2. Bandwidth around 2-2.5 MHz, sensitivity: max possible
3. Matching layer for water
4. Depend, let's say 100 mm on coaxial cable
5. Don't know medical norm
6. Maybe needed for medical norm don't know
