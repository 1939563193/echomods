* march-2017: button type transducer with a PCB lid

### Notes

#### 2015

* Contact with Dr. Geng
* We do have a 3.5 MHz transducer. This transducer has a very low profile (4mm) and the active diameter is 17 mm. the focal length is 125 mm. The overall diameter is 19.5 mm. 
* Price 350$ / pc, 100USD as bottom line for bigger volumes.
* For 3 frequencies, would go down from 199 to 249$

* __Rmq:__  Based on your focal zone requirement you need the transducers with a F# about 6 to achieve the results you need. I used a formulae as below,-3dB focal zone =7.1 x wavelength x F#^2, here F#=focal length/aperture

#### 2016

_We propose a button type transducer with a PCB lid which has two soldering pads on it._
