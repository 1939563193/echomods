# Mistras UTC110




* Using AD8332 (TGC) + AZ4126 (ADC)
* Gain 0 to 80dB = use of both LNAs

* MD1213 + PICO transfo to get 250V (PWM controlled)
* They use a 8NM50N 500V N-Channel Mosfet to drive the piezo
* The 1K large resistors are on the input path
* General Electric use digital switches in their DM5E and DMS GO+ thickness gauges
* CY7C68013A-56 from Cypress,
