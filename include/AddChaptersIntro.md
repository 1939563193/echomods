#### Chapter1

Introduction to ultrasound hacking 

This chapter provides the first elements to understand ultrasound imaging, why we chose to work with modules, and what we've done so far.

We will cover:

* [Principles of ultrasound imaging](https://kelu124.gitbooks.io/echomods/content/Chapter1/principles.md)
* [Principle of the modules](https://kelu124.gitbooks.io/echomods/content/Chapter1/modules.md)
* [Summary of the modules](https://kelu124.gitbooks.io/echomods/content/Chapter1/listofmodules.md)

Have fun !

#### Chapter2

Working with a dev kit 

We'll start with a short description of the work we've done with [a custom beaglebone black cape](https://kelu124.gitbooks.io/echomods/content/devkit0.html)

We'll also detail in this chapter the different elements that constitute a basic working kit to hack ultrasound, representing [the custom boards plugged to a probe found on ebay](https://kelu124.gitbooks.io/echomods/content/Chapter2/basicdevkit.html)

* [Basic dev kit](basicdevkit.md)
* [The probe](retroATL3.md)
* [Power supply](mogaba.md)
* [Pulser](tobo.md)
* [Analog Processing](goblin.md)
* [Signal Acquisition](toadkiller.md)
* [Results](results.md)

We'll also cover what happens when you wire up and use the [wireless ultrasound imaging kit](https://kelu124.gitbooks.io/echomods/content/devkit11.html).

Have fun !

#### Chapter3

Other modules (work in progress) 

Even if the modules described earlier were sufficient to start imaging, the following modules could be used  to better suit your specific needs:

* [Signal emulator](https://kelu124.gitbooks.io/echomods/content/Chapter3/silent.md)
* [Slow transducer](https://kelu124.gitbooks.io/echomods/content/Chapter3/cletus.md)
* [Slow processing](https://kelu124.gitbooks.io/echomods/content/Chapter3/croaker.md)
* [Wireless acquisition](https://kelu124.gitbooks.io/echomods/content/Chapter3/kina.md)
* [Motherboard](https://kelu124.gitbooks.io/echomods/content/Chapter3/doj.md)
* [Wood encasing](https://kelu124.gitbooks.io/echomods/content/Chapter3/sleepy.md)
* [Sourcing the modules](sourcing.md)

Have fun!

#### Chapter4

Worklogs 

This chapter is dedicated to the brain_dumps that took place during [the first iteration worklog](https://kelu124.gitbooks.io/echomods/content/Chapter4/murgenworklog.html), which started on Nov 24th 2015, and in the second phase for the [modules raw worklog](https://kelu124.gitbooks.io/echomods/content/Chapter4/rawworklog.html).

It also contains [notes on specific topics](https://kelu124.gitbooks.io/echomods/content/Chapter4/detailedlog.html).

Have fun!

#### Chapter5

Data samples 

Some data samples! You'll find:

* standards and convention on the [Data format](https://kelu124.gitbooks.io/echomods/content/Chapter5/dataformat.html);
* the [images from the first iteration](https://kelu124.gitbooks.io/echomods/content/Chapter5/images.html), 
* the [images from the wireless module](https://kelu124.gitbooks.io/echomods/content/Chapter5/croaker_data.html), 
* and the [images the coming from a vintage probe](https://kelu124.gitbooks.io/echomods/content/Chapter5/loops.html).

Have fun!
