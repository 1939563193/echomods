#### Chapter1

Introduction to ultrasound hacking 

This chapter provides the first elements to understand ultrasound imaging, the reasons behind working with modules, and what has been done so far.

We will cover:

* [Principles of ultrasound imaging](https://kelu124.gitbooks.io/echomods/Chapter1/principles.md)
* [Principle of the modules](https://kelu124.gitbooks.io/echomods/Chapter1/modules.md)
* [Genesis of the project](https://kelu124.gitbooks.io/echomods/Chapter1/history.html)
* [Summary of the modules](https://kelu124.gitbooks.io/echomods/Chapter1/listofmodules.md)
* [Introducing the Pi](https://kelu124.gitbooks.io/echomods/RPI.html)

Have fun !

#### Chapter2

Working with a dev kit 

We'll start with what happens when you wire up and use the [wireless ultrasound imaging kit](https://kelu124.gitbooks.io/echomods/devkit11.html).

We'll continue with a short description of the work we've done with [a custom beaglebone black cape](https://kelu124.gitbooks.io/echomods/devkit0.html)

We'll also detail in this chapter the different elements that constitute a basic working kit to hack ultrasound, representing [the custom boards plugged to a probe found on ebay](https://kelu124.gitbooks.io/echomods/Chapter2/basicdevkit.html):

* [Basic dev kit](basicdevkit.md)
* [The probe](retroATL3.md)
* [Power supply](mogaba.md)
* [Pulser](tobo.md)
* [Analog Processing](goblin.md)
* [Signal Acquisition](toadkiller.md)
* [Results](results.md)

More interestingly, we'll get to what we can get using [the very same modules, a cheap transducer, and a Pi](https://kelu124.gitbooks.io/echomods/RPI_article.html)


Have fun !

#### Chapter3

A list of the different modules that have been or are being used (work in progress) 

Even if the modules described earlier were sufficient to start imaging, the following modules could be used  to better suit your specific needs:

* [A rapid ADC for Raspberry Pi](https://kelu124.gitbooks.io/echomods/RPI_article.html)
* [The Pulser module](thttps://kelu124.gitbooks.io/echomods/Chapter2/tobo.md)
* [The Analog Processing Module](https://kelu124.gitbooks.io/echomods/Chapter2/goblin.md)
* [Signal Acquisition](https://kelu124.gitbooks.io/echomods/Chapter2/toadkiller.md)
* Using a ebay [ultrasound probe, the ATL3](https://kelu124.gitbooks.io/echomods/Chapter2/retroATL3.html)
* [Signal emulator](https://kelu124.gitbooks.io/echomods/Chapter3/silent.md)
* [Slow transducer](https://kelu124.gitbooks.io/echomods/Chapter3/cletus.md)
* [Slow processing](https://kelu124.gitbooks.io/echomods/Chapter3/croaker.md) 
* [Motherboard](https://kelu124.gitbooks.io/echomods/Chapter3/doj.md)
* [Wood encasing](https://kelu124.gitbooks.io/echomods/Chapter3/sleepy.md)
* [Power supply](mogaba.md)

Have fun!

#### Chapter4

Worklogs 

This chapter is dedicated to the brain_dumps that took place during [the first iteration worklog](https://kelu124.gitbooks.io/echomods/Chapter4/murgenworklog.html), which started on Nov 24th 2015, and in the second phase for the [modules raw worklog](https://kelu124.gitbooks.io/echomods/Chapter4/rawworklog.html).

It also contains [notes on specific topics](https://kelu124.gitbooks.io/echomods/Chapter4/detailedlog.html).

Have fun!

#### Chapter5

Data samples 

Some data samples! You'll find:

* standards and convention on the [Data format](https://kelu124.gitbooks.io/echomods/Chapter5/dataformat.html);
* the [images from the first iteration](https://kelu124.gitbooks.io/echomods/Chapter5/images.html), 
* the [images from the wireless module](https://kelu124.gitbooks.io/echomods/Chapter5/croaker_data.html), 
* and the [images the coming from a vintage probe](https://kelu124.gitbooks.io/echomods/Chapter5/loops.html).

Have fun!
