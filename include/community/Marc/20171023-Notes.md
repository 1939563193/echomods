We couldn't solve the SPI issue with Raspberry Pi i don't believe they are compatible for a high data rate. 

SPI on the goblin requires you to bring the chip select line high then low again between sampling of a word (in this case 2 bytes).

As the raspberry pi isn't an RTOS system, background processes take over between your instructions.

So there is a huge delay between after bringing the chip select high which meant instead of being able to sample at 3MSPS it begame 200kSPS which for our purposes was too low.

Blue = clock (4 segments of 8 bits (1 byte))

Green = chip select.

To achieve 3MSPS the chip slect line would need to go low-> high-> low in the time between the first 2 bytes and the second 2 bytes.
