## Introduction

### Objective

The aim of this project is to build a small ultrasound imaging hardware and software development kit, with the specific goal of:

- consolidating [existing hardware research](http://openhardware.metajnl.com/articles/10.5334/joh.2/);
- simplifing / lowering the cost of the kit;
- providing a benchmark of ultrasound systems;
- introducing a simple API to control hardware;
- having a server which provides raw ultrasound data, and for ultrasound imaging, can deliver standard DICOM files;
- having a kit that can be used for pedagogical and academic purposes - not to mention people who want to understand ultrasound!

Previous project has prooved the feasibility of the hardware, but was not simple enough. Let's keep the momentum, and apply this dev kit to other projects as well - such as dopplers, non-destructive testing, using piezos as sensors.


### Way of work

The objective is simple - it's to build an _analog "debugging tool"_ to explore ultrasound systems. Several previous setups were tested with Murgen (the previous iteration), and the proof was made that it's possible to have a small ultrasound scanner in one's garage. But it's also exciting to build the tools and explore the different components.. and that's what this project aims at exploring.

Hardware is basically already built: previous lessons from [Murgen](https://hackaday.io/project/9281-murgen) bring the analog front end and pulsers, there's also a [probe emulator](/silent/): what remains is :

* First, to _remove overkills on the modules_, and SIMPLIFY everything, making it more robust and more user friendly.
* Secondly, to _develop a good driver for the Raspberry Pi_, to control the hardware, and develop a good enough server API.

So, on with this project, and see if cross-pollination works =) 

## Architecture

Ultrasound imaging has evolved since the first ultrasound machine appeared. The first devices were using single-sensor (transducers) techniques, coupled with mechanical scanning - hence allowing a single signal processing channel. The architecture of such systems, as shown below, is well-known and formed the basis of ultrasound imaging.

This kit consists of several modules mainly built from easily available components - after a short benchmark of [existing ICs](https://kelu124.gitbooks.io/echomods/content/Chapter6/bench.html). Two electronic modules were specifically designed to provide the basic development kit. 

* the Transducer Pulser Module (TPM): designed to provide a precise high-voltage pulse, necessary to excite the sensor, while remaining robust enough to be controlled by an Arduino;
* the Analog Processing Module (APM): designed to correctly process the raw ultrasound electric signal, while easily exposing all intermediary signals, and exposing a digital output to the user.

A modular approach was chosen to ensure that each key component inside the ultrasound image processing can easily be replaced and compared with another module. Each electronic module takes the place of a function in the signal processing chain or allows tapping into the different signals circulating between the blocks. 

## Assembly guide 

### Required materials

* A [pulser board](/tobo/) - to generate the high voltage pulse to use the transducer
* An [analog front end](/goblin/) - to amplify the weak signals generated by the echoes
* an [ADC cape](/elmo/) - a custom made 11Msps to 22Msps ADC pHAT for Raspberries.
* a [Raspberry Pi, 0 or W](/tomtom/) to manage everything
* the [motherboard, v2](/doj/) - to connect the different modules together
* and some extras such as headers, jumpers, and a smallish OLED screen

For the transducer, one can use either a [ATL mechanical probe](/retroATL3/) for example, or a [piezo + servo setup](/cletus), to mechanically scan the medium to be imaged
