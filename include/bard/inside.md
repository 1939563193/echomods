### Inside the head

Ferrite bead on the fatest cable (small coax): seems that's where the signal is.

### Small ICs in the head

Back of the IC: R5C IC 3 pins components ... possibly LM4040CIM3X-5.0 . Voltage references.. what for?

Impedance test from the cable show that pairs have impedance of 
* 6.6 OHm : Red/green and Red Blue
* 2.2 0hm :  green and blue
* 11 Ohm between Red and yellow

### 8 pins head

1. Pin 1: Red cable from the Red/Green pair 
2. Pin 2: Green and blue cables from the Red/Green and Blue/Yellow Pairs 
3. Pin 3: purple cable. Outter shield from the coax cable
4. Pin 4: Floating
5. Pin 5: Black from the inner shield from the coax cable
6. Pin 6: black cable from fat grey cable 
7. Pin 7: white cable from fat grey cable 
8. Pin 8: Yellow cable from the blue/yellow pair
