# How to build a ultrasound imaging dev-kit ?

## Genesis

In early 2014, I met with what would become the echOpen's cofounders. The objective then was to explore old technologies used in ultrasound, and see what one could do with those, in open-source.

Fast-forward summer 2015, got some funds and we settled in Hotel-Dieu. After the "difficult" first steps - none of us were electrical engineers! -, a community started aggregating. In November 2015, a technical meeting took decisions, from which I wanted to diverge, and started exploring an empty fork, based on the idea of using a beaglebone and a maximum of off-the-shelf SMD components to assemble something.



## A first iteration



## Going into modules

After a second technical meeting in April, we thought it a good idea to split functions into separate modules. That gave birth to [these echomods](https://github.com/kelu124/echomods/), with a first series of modules.
