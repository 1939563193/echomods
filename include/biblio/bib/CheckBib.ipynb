The proposed system has two parts: wireless transducer with embedded pre-processing unit, and back-end module for image reconstruction and display purpose. The embedded pre-processing unit consist of analog and digital integrated circuits, transmit beamforming, low noise amplification, time gain compensation and receive beam forming. The output of wireless transducer is scanline data, which is transmitted to back-end module via wireless communication transceiver. The complete back-end module is implemented on a Zedboard platform which comes with FPGA and ARM processor.

This way acquisition times and power consumption of ultrasound imaging can be reduced for low power mobile devices based on consumer electronics realizing the transition from FPGA or ASIC based beamforming into more flexible software beamforming.

A noise analysis is performed, and the minimum signal-to-noise ratio (SNR) requirements are derived for the low-noise amplifiers (LNAs) and A/D converters (ADCs) to fulfill the design specifications of a dynamic range of 60 dB and a penetration depth of 160 mm in the B-mode image.

In this study complex object data were recorded coherently in a two-dimensional hologram using a 3.5 MHz single transducer with a fairly wide-angle beam. Image reconstruction which applies the wavefront backward propagation method and the near-field curvature compensation was performed numerically in a microcomputer using the spatial frequency domain. This approach allows an efficient use of the FFT-algorithms. Because of the simple and fast scanning scheme and the efficient reconstruction algorithms the method can be made real-time. The image quality of the proposed method was studied by evaluating the spatial and dynamical resolution in a waterbath and in a typical tissue-mimicking phantom. The lateral as well as the range resolution (-6 dB) were approximately 1 mm in the depth range of 30-100 mm. The dynamical resolution could be improved considerably when the beam width was made narrower.

For 69 cardiac patients with informed consent, image quality was compared with those obtained with basic range diagnostic echo machines. Left ventricular ejection fraction (EF) derived from normal M-mode image of standard machines (EFm) were compared with visual EF of the ultra-portable ultrasound device (EFv). The image quality was comparable to the basic range diagnostic echo machines although short axis view of aortic root was not clearly visualized because the probe was too large for intercostal approach. EFv agreed well with EFm.

Unfortunately, ultrasound is nearly absent in many rural healthcare facilities in developing regions due to the high costs of both equipment and required training. To leverage existing healthcare systems commonly found in these contexts, we have focused our efforts on increasing the diagnostic capabilities of midwives -- often central medical figures in rural and low-income communities. We have designed and built a low-cost portable ultrasound device consisting of a USB ultrasound probe and a touchscreen netbook for a total cost of around USD3500. Compared to currently available ultrasound devices, we simplified the user interface while maintaining functionality to allow midwives to detect three common obstetrical conditions: placenta previa, multiple gestations, and breech presentation. To evaluate our solution, we tested the accuracy of ultrasound measurements, image quality, and whether midwives could use ultrasound. Testing performed by nine clinicians indicated our device would be appropriate for identifying the three conditions. Our modular design approach allows for easy modification, and the device is designed to utilize existing local healthcare resources in order to create a sustainable solution that does not depend on continuous foreign assistance.', u'author': u'Brunette, Waylon and Gerard, Wayne and Hicks, Matthew A. and Hope, Alexis and Ishimitsu, Mitchell and Prasad, Pratik and Anderson, Ruth E. and Borriello, Gaetano and Kolko, Beth E. and Nathan, Robert', u'year': u'2010', 'ENTRYTYPE': u'inproceedings', u'link': u'http://doi.acm.org/10.1145/1926180.1926209', u'address': u'New York, NY, USA', u'urldate': u'2018-01-19', 'ID': 'brunette_portable_2010', u'pages': u'23:1--23:10'}, {u'doi': u'10.1109/TNSRE.2013.2274657', u'author': u'Sikdar, S. and Rangwala, H. and Eastlake, E.

However, the development of control strategies for such prosthetics has lagged significantly behind. Conventional noninvasive myoelectric control strategies rely on the amplitude of electromyography (EMG) signals from flexor and extensor muscles in the forearm. Surface EMG has limited specificity for deep contiguous muscles because of cross talk and cannot reliably differentiate between individual digit and joint motions. We present a novel ultrasound imaging based control strategy for upper arm prosthetics that can overcome many of the limitations of myoelectric control. Real time ultrasound images of the forearm muscles were obtained using a wearable mechanically scanned single element ultrasound system, and analyzed to create maps of muscle activity based on changes in the ultrasound echogenicity of the muscle during contraction. Individual digit movements were associated with unique maps of activity. These maps were correlated with previously acquired training data to classify individual digit movements. Preliminary results using ten healthy volunteers demonstrated this approach could provide robust classification of individual finger movements with 98\\\\% accuracy (precision 96\\\\%-100\\\\% and recall 97\\\\%-100\\\\% for individual finger flexions). The change in ultrasound echogenicity was found to be proportional to the digit flexion speed (R2=0.9), and thus our proposed strategy provided a proportional signal that can be used for fine control. We anticipate that ultrasound imaging based control strategies could be a significant improvement over conventional myoelectric control of prosthetics.', u'issn': u'1534-4320', u'number': u'1', u'month': u'jan', u'volume': u'22', u'pages': u'69--76', u'file': u'IEEE Xplore Abstract Record:/home/kelu/Zotero/storage/76VERC2J/Sikdar et al. - 2014 - Novel Method for Predicting Dexterous Individual F.html:text/html', u'year': u'2014', 'ID': 'sikdar_novel_2014', u'journal': u'IEEE Transactions on Neural Systems and Rehabilitation Engineering'}, {u'doi': u'10.1177/016173460803000104', u'author': u'Richard, William D. and Zar, David M. and Solek, Roman', u'language': u'eng', u'title': u'A low-cost {B}-mode {USB} ultrasound probe', 'ENTRYTYPE': u'article', u'abstract': u'The Universal Serial Bus (USB) is now the ubiquitous interface bus of choice for connecting peripherals to personal computers and laptops.

A new technique to enhance the spatial resolution of pulse-echo imaging systems is presented. The method attempts to build an image that could be obtained with a transducer array aperture larger than that physically available. We consider two images of the same object obtained with two different apertures, the full aperture and a subaperture, of the same transducer. A suitable artificial neural network (ANN) is trained to reproduce the relationship between the image obtained with the transducer full aperture and the image obtained with a subaperture. The inputs of the neural network are portions of the image obtained with the subaperture (low resolution image), and the target outputs are the corresponding portions of the image produced by the full aperture (high resolution image). After the network is trained, it can produce images with almost the same resolution of the full aperture transducer, but using a reduced number of real transducer elements. All computations are carried out on envelope-detected decimated images; for this reason, the computational cost is low and the method is suitable for real-time applications. The proposed method was applied to experimental data obtained with the ultrasound synthetic aperture focusing technique (SAFT), giving quite promising results.

An upper sideband processor using the filter method to maximize signal bandwidth and in which the lower sideband aliases was built. This processor has a transducer bandwidth of 0.5 to 20 MHz and can resolve echoes 90-ns apart. The spurious products of practical mixers and amplifiers make the aliased approach impractical due to high noise and distortion. By using a bandpass filter after the mixer, distortion is reduced. A processor built with a lower sideband filter method yielded the lowest distortion and noise. The lower sideband processor has a bandwidth of 2 to 42 MHz and can resolve echoes 60-ns apart. With a single-cycle tone-burst processor input, ringing in the IF filter causes temporal asymmetry of the output pulse, while ringing in the detector filter causes ringing in the output pulse.

The FPGA controls the ultrasound transmission and ultrasound and photoacoustic data acquisition process of a customized 16-channel module that contains all of the necessary analog and digital circuits. The 16-channel module is one of multiple modules plugged into a motherboard; their beamformed outputs are made available for a digital signal processor (DSP) to access using an external memory interface (EMIF). The FPGA performs a key role through ultrafast reconfiguration and adaptation of its structure to allow real-time switching between the two imaging modes, including transmission control, laser synchronization, internal memory structure, beamforming, and EMIF structure and memory size. It performs another role by parallel accessing of internal memories and multi-thread processing to reduce the transfer of data and the processing load on the DSP. Furthermore, because the laser will be pulsing even during ultrasound pulse-echo acquisition, the FPGA ensures that the laser pulses are far enough from the pulse-echo acquisitions by appropriate time-division multiplexing (TDM).

Acquired radio frequency (R-F) echo signals and their envelope are analyzed for this purpose. A computer-controlled vacuum system with a digital pressure control loop was developed for precise and reproducible deformation. In a first processing step, the skin surface is segmented. Local axial strains inside the skin are estimated from axial displacements, which are estimated from consecutive echo signal frames analyzing the phase of the complex cross correlation function of analytical echo signals. Furthermore, speckle tracking is applied to estimate axial and lateral displacements and to quantify axial and lateral strains. The correlation coefficient of windowed echo signals compensated for displacements are used as a measure to validate the estimated strains, which is essential to accomplish reliable in vivo measurements.

We propose a fully hardware-based processor dedicated to real-time ultrasonic signal processing, which incorporates a preprocessing core, a low-power memory, an interpolation unit, and a priority assignment unit. This Ph.D. thesis represents an important contribution towards the complete integration of an ultrasound preprocessing system within the probe and the implementation of a new type of wireless UMI device.  During the last two decades, several UMI system miniaturization approaches have been presented in the literature. Some Authors proposed their front-end circuit integration and introduced hardware-based ultrasound signal processing units based on new algorithms. Research efforts in this area are driven by the increasing industrial interest on miniaturized UMI devices and by the development of new applications that benefit from the miniaturization of this technology. Moreover, the increasing performance of programmable circuits, such as FPGA, offers appropriate characteristics for the implementation of new UMI systems.  Most UMI system architectures found in the literature are based in whole or in part on a software implementation that uses a central processing unit (CPU) or a digital signal processor (DSP). This software approach provides flexibility and facilitates the implementation of processing algorithms which are becoming ever more effective and complex. However, to provide real-time ultrasound image processing, these systems require high-power consumption or are too large for a complete system integration on a single chip (SoC).', u'author': u'L\\xe9vesque, Philippe', u'month': u'jan', u'link': u'https://publications.polymtl.ca/509/', u'file': u\"Full Text PDF:/home/kelu/Zotero/storage/QDB5UBXA/L\\xe9vesque - 2011 - Architecture d'un processeur d\\xe9di\\xe9 aux traitements.pdf:application/pdf;Snapshot:/home/kelu/Zotero/storage/QXWRTVTP/L\\xe9vesque - 2011 - Architecture d'un processeur d\\xe9di\\xe9 aux traitements.html:text/html\", u'year': u'2011', u'urldate': u'2018-01-19', 'ID': 'levesque_architecture_2011', u'type': u'phd', 'ENTRYTYPE': u'phdthesis'}, {u'doi': u'10.1109/ULTSYM.2013.0526', u'keyword': u'biomedical ultrasonics, image reconstruction, medical image processing, scan conversion, Ultrasonic imaging, graphics processing units, Imaging, smart phones, ultrasonic imaging, quadrature demodulation, patient diagnosis, application specific integrated circuits, application-specific integrated circuits, portable instruments, graphics processing unit, portable ultrasound imaging system, Smartphone, 850\\xd7800 image reconstruction, Androids, application process, application processors, ASIC approach, Band-pass filters, core functional blocks, core ultrasound B-mode image processing, core ultrasound B-mode signal processing, high-end Android smartphone, Humanoid robots, POC systems, Samsung Galaxy Note II, Smart phones, smartphone-based portable ultrasound imaging system, total execution time, ultrasound B-mode image reconstruction, well-defined targeted applications', u'shorttitle': u'Smartphone-based portable ultrasound imaging system', u'author': u'Kim, Kyu Cheol and Kim, Min Jae and Joo, Hyun Suk and Lee, Wooyoul and Yoon, Changhan and Song, Tai-Kyong and Yoo, Yangmo', 'ENTRYTYPE': u'inproceedings', u'abstract': u\"There is a growing need of portable ultrasound imaging systems since it can allow clinicians to access and diagnose a patient at the scene of an accident or at the patient's bedside due to their improved accessibility.

The focus of this work was to develop an easy-to-use platform kit (hardware and software) for providing the community a complete experimental setup for ultrasound imaging at a low cost, without the need for expensive and non-modifiable specific equipment. The goal of this work resembles the needs of medical systems in the 80\\u2019s where analog techniques using single-sensor devices were prominent. To this end, two open-source, arduino-like modules have been developed for building a simple, yet complete, single-channel analog front-end system, where all the intermediary signals are readily accessible by the user. A single-channel architecture avoids the beamforming overhead, though it limits the quality of the captured image, and brings simplicity to the system. The modules were tested using re-purposed ultrasound mechanical probes, as well as non-medical transducers. Furthermore, different digital acquisition systems were utilized for providing the images of interest. The developed modules can also be used in Radio Frequency (RF) projects, non-destructive testing and control projects, as well as in low-cost medical imaging projects on non-living samples.', u'issn': u'2514-1708', u'number': u'1', u'month': u'mar', u'volume': u'1', u'link': u'http://openhardware.metajnl.com/articles/10.5334/joh.2/', u'author': u'Jonveaux, Luc', u'file': u'Snapshot:/home/kelu/Zotero/storage/7G5R53S8/Jonveaux - 2017 - Arduino-like development kit for single-element ul.html:text/html', u'year': u'2017', u'urldate': u'2018-01-19', u'keyword': u'electronics, imaging, modules, Ultrasound', u'journal': u'Journal of Open Hardware', 'ID': 'jonveaux_arduino-like_2017'}, {u'doi': u'10.1109/EMBC.2016.7591892', u'keyword': u'Array signal processing, biomedical ultrasonics, field programmable gate arrays, Field programmable gate arrays, Transducers, Ultrasonic imaging, ultrasonic imaging, Biomedical imaging, Hardware, nondestructive testing, 128-channel FPGA, analog front-end AFE5805, biomedical education, biomedical imaging processing algorithms, biomedical signal processing algorithms, biomedical students, commercial ultrasound scanners, MD2131 beamformer source driver, medical diagnostic applications, PC based ultrasound imaging system, research activities, teaching activities', u'author': u'Assef, A.

This paper presents a mechanical scanning device incorporating a high-frequency transducer specifically as a proof of concept for US capsule endoscopy (USCE), providing information that may usefully assist future research. A rotary solenoid-coil-based motor was employed to rotate the US transducer with sectional electronic control. A set of gears was used to convert the sectional rotation to circular rotation. A single-element focused US transducer with 39-MHz center frequency was used for high-resolution US imaging, connected to an imaging platform for pulse generation and image processing. Key parameters of US imaging for USCE applications were evaluated. Wire phantom imaging and tissue phantom imaging have been conducted to evaluate the performance of the proposed method. A porcine small intestine specimen was also used for imaging evaluation in vitro.

By means of its thermal or mechanical effects, HIFU is able to serve as a direct tool for tissue ablation, or an indirect moderating medium to manipulate microbubbles or perform heating (hyperthermia) for the purpose of targeted drug delivery. The development and testing of HIFU based phased arrays is favorable as their elements allow for individual phasing to steer and focus the beam. While FDA has already approved tissue ablation by HIFU for the treatment of uterine fibroids (2004) and pain from bone metastases (2012), development continues on other possible applications that are less forgiving of incomplete treatment, such as thermal necrosis of malignant masses.Ideally, each element, of such an array must have its own fully programmable electrical driving channel, which allows the control of delay, phase, and amplitude of the output from each element. To enable full control, each channel needs a waveform generator, an amplification device, and an impedance matching circuit between driver and acoustic element.Similar projects utilizing this approach to drive therapeutic arrays include a 512-channel therapy system which was built at the University of Michigan using low cost Field-Programmable Gate Arrays (FPGA) microcontroller and highly efficient MOSFET switching amplifiers [1]. However, this system lacks the ability to drive both, continuous wave (CW) and transient short duty-cycle high power pulses.This paper presents a hybrid system, which is able to perform CW and transient short duty-cycle high power excitation.

Very recently, the discovery of compressive sensing has shown that the signal structure can be exploited to reduce the burden posed by traditional sensing requirements. In this spirit, we have designed a simple ultrasound imaging device that can perform three-dimensional imaging using just a single ultrasound sensor. Our device makes a compressed measurement of the spatial ultrasound field using a plastic aperture mask placed in front of the ultrasound sensor. The aperture mask ensures that every pixel in the image is uniquely identifiable in the compressed measurement. We demonstrate that this device can successfully image two structured objects placed in water. The need for just one sensor instead of thousands paves the way for cheaper, faster, simpler, and smaller sensing devices and possible new clinical applications.\\nCompressive 3D ultrasound imaging is possible with only one sensor and a simple aperture coding mask.\\nCompressive 3D ultrasound imaging is possible with only one sensor and a simple aperture coding mask.', u'issn': u'2375-2548', u'number': u'12', u'month': u'dec', u'volume': u'3', u'pages': u'e1701423', u'link': u'http://advances.sciencemag.org/content/3/12/e1701423', u'author': u'Kruizinga, Pieter and Meulen, Pim van der and Fedjajevs, Andrejs and Mastik, Frits and Springeling, Geert and Jong, Nico de and Bosch, Johannes G. and Leus, Geert', u'file': u'Snapshot:/home/kelu/Zotero/storage/GT29BZEC/Kruizinga et al. - 2017 - Compressive 3D ultrasound imaging using a single s.html:text/html', u'year': u'2017', u'urldate': u'2018-01-19', 'ID': 'kruizinga_compressive_2017', u'annote': u'Single-pixel ultrasound approach.\\nAwesome work with the mask.\\nTo be replicated =)', u'journal': u'Science Advances'}, {u'doi': u'10.1109/ULTSYM.2012.0542', u'keyword': u'array signal processing, biomedical ultrasonics, Field programmable gate arrays, Transducers, Ultrasonic imaging, Imaging, Real-time systems, Image resolution, Arrays, ultrasonic imaging, biological tissues, contrast-to-noise ratio, field programmable technology, flexible annular array imaging platform, imaging tool, microultrasound, multichannel dynamic beamforming technique, tissue phantom measurements', u'author': u'Qiu, W. and Yu, Y. and Chabok, H.

The transducer in ultrasound system was driven by a pulse train generator, which delivers high-voltage bipolar or unipolar pulse train. Several recent papers have discussed both the importance and the design of unipolar and bipolar pulse generator for ultrasound applications. Bipolar voltage pulse has lower unwanted DC and low-frequency component could decrease the leakage current. Also, its peak-to-peak pulse voltage could achieve twice of the voltage rating of the coaxial cable connecting the generator and the transducer. In current commercial ultrasound systems, bipolar pulse generators are commonly used; however, it still had some disadvantages like longer pulse length, which limited the driving frequency and affect the signal performance. This paper purposed a novel design of bipolar pulse generator based on a novel dual P-N channel MOSFET and FPGA timing control. It could produce multi-cycle pulses with center frequency over 50 MHz and shorter pulse length. This design also preserved the low-cost advantage compared to other commercial design of bipolar pulse generator.
