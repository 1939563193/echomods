To address this issue, we discussed the feasibility of realizing wireless ultrasound transducer and as a proof of concept we built the prototype of wireless ultrasound transducer based scanning system. The proposed system has two parts: wireless transducer with embedded pre-processing unit, and back-end module for image reconstruction and display purpose. The embedded pre-processing unit consist of analog and digital integrated circuits, transmit beamforming, low noise amplification, time gain compensation and receive beam forming. The output of wireless transducer is scanline data, which is transmitted to back-end module via wireless communication transceiver. The complete back-end module is implemented on a Zedboard platform which comes with FPGA and ARM processor. The signal processing algorithms, which include envelope detection, log compression, scan conversion, interpolation and decimation algorithms are implemented on FPGA, while ARM processor is used to control and coordinate between signal processing modules.

Emerging technologies like ultrafast ultrasound imaging result in new algorithms for example for shearwave elastography or vector velocity imaging but also enable the creation of a full image with only one excitation/reception event based on plane wave imaging. This way acquisition times and power consumption of ultrasound imaging can be reduced for low power mobile devices based on consumer electronics realizing the transition from FPGA or ASIC based beamforming into more flexible software beamforming. This is usually performed on a GPU utilizing massive parallel processing (like CUDA or OpenCL) but with the development of modern processors (A7, A8 and A8X) for its smartphones and tablets Apple introduced parallel GPU hardware and the framework \\u201cMetal\\u201d for advanced graphics and general purpose GPU processing for the iOS platform.

A noise analysis is performed, and the minimum signal-to-noise ratio (SNR) requirements are derived for the low-noise amplifiers (LNAs) and A/D converters (ADCs) to fulfill the design specifications of a dynamic range of 60 dB and a penetration depth of 160 mm in the B-mode image.

Side lobes below -60 dB are achievable for both methods. Validation of the method is achieved by scanning a simple wire phantom and a complex phantom containing wires in azimuth and elevation. The simple wire phantom shows the same results as that found through simulation. The complex phantom shows simultaneous focusing in azimuth and elevation for the wire scatterers.

Image reconstruction which applies the wavefront backward propagation method and the near-field curvature compensation was performed numerically in a microcomputer using the spatial frequency domain. This approach allows an efficient use of the FFT-algorithms. Because of the simple and fast scanning scheme and the efficient reconstruction algorithms the method can be made real-time. The image quality of the proposed method was studied by evaluating the spatial and dynamical resolution in a waterbath and in a typical tissue-mimicking phantom. The lateral as well as the range resolution (-6 dB) were approximately 1 mm in the depth range of 30-100 mm. The dynamical resolution could be improved considerably when the beam width was made narrower.

However, the development of control strategies for such prosthetics has lagged significantly behind. Conventional noninvasive myoelectric control strategies rely on the amplitude of electromyography (EMG) signals from flexor and extensor muscles in the forearm. Surface EMG has limited specificity for deep contiguous muscles because of cross talk and cannot reliably differentiate between individual digit and joint motions. We present a novel ultrasound imaging based control strategy for upper arm prosthetics that can overcome many of the limitations of myoelectric control. Real time ultrasound images of the forearm muscles were obtained using a wearable mechanically scanned single element ultrasound system, and analyzed to create maps of muscle activity based on changes in the ultrasound echogenicity of the muscle during contraction. Individual digit movements were associated with unique maps of activity. These maps were correlated with previously acquired training data to classify individual digit movements. Preliminary results using ten healthy volunteers demonstrated this approach could provide robust classification of individual finger movements with 98\\\\% accuracy (precision 96\\\\%-100\\\\% and recall 97\\\\%-100\\\\% for individual finger flexions). The change in ultrasound echogenicity was found to be proportional to the digit flexion speed (R2=0.9), and thus our proposed strategy provided a proportional signal that can be used for fine control. We anticipate that ultrasound imaging based control strategies could be a significant improvement over conventional myoelectric control of prosthetics.', u'issn': u'1534-4320', u'number': u'1', u'month': u'jan', u'volume': u'22', u'pages': u'69--76', u'file': u'IEEE Xplore Abstract Record:/home/kelu/Zotero/storage/76VERC2J/Sikdar et al. - 2014 - Novel Method for Predicting Dexterous Individual F.html:text/html', u'year': u'2014', 'ID': 'sikdar_novel_2014', u'journal': u'IEEE Transactions on Neural Systems and Rehabilitation Engineering'}, {u'doi': u'10.1177/016173460803000104', u'author': u'Richard, William D. and Zar, David M. and Solek, Roman', u'language': u'eng', u'title': u'A low-cost {B}-mode {USB} ultrasound probe', 'ENTRYTYPE': u'article', u'abstract': u'The Universal Serial Bus (USB) is now the ubiquitous interface bus of choice for connecting peripherals to personal computers and laptops. USB 2.0 is a half-duplex bus running at 480 Mb/s and each peripheral can draw as much as 500 mA of current at a nominal 5 V from the USB connector. We have developed a family of USB-based, B-mode probes that connect directly to a personal computer or laptop and that draw as little as 250 mA (1.25 W) when forming ten 5 MHz images/second. The pulser/receiver, high voltage supply, analog-to-digital converter, servo and USB interface are implemented on a small circuit board inside the probe body. After raw data are transferred to the computer, gain compensation, interpolation, filtering and other data processing are performed by the host processor. This gives flexibility to developers and allows enhancements to the system to be incorporated via software updates. In addition, the raw data are available for storage and later postprocessing. There are several advantages to this architectural approach to B-mode imaging, including low cost, portability and optimal signal-to-noise performance.

A new technique to enhance the spatial resolution of pulse-echo imaging systems is presented. The method attempts to build an image that could be obtained with a transducer array aperture larger than that physically available. We consider two images of the same object obtained with two different apertures, the full aperture and a subaperture, of the same transducer. A suitable artificial neural network (ANN) is trained to reproduce the relationship between the image obtained with the transducer full aperture and the image obtained with a subaperture. The inputs of the neural network are portions of the image obtained with the subaperture (low resolution image), and the target outputs are the corresponding portions of the image produced by the full aperture (high resolution image). After the network is trained, it can produce images with almost the same resolution of the full aperture transducer, but using a reduced number of real transducer elements. All computations are carried out on envelope-detected decimated images; for this reason, the computational cost is low and the method is suitable for real-time applications. The proposed method was applied to experimental data obtained with the ultrasound synthetic aperture focusing technique (SAFT), giving quite promising results.

It is also possible to assure reduced bias and uncertainty in critical TOF measurements, such as those involving low signal-to-noise ratio (SNR) as well as severe distortion of echo shape. A number of numerical tests are conducted on simulated signals with the aim of highlighting the good performance of the method when operating in critical conditions; to reduce the computational burden without losing significance in the analysis, a statistical experimental design-based technique is enlisted.

An upper sideband processor using the filter method to maximize signal bandwidth and in which the lower sideband aliases was built. This processor has a transducer bandwidth of 0.5 to 20 MHz and can resolve echoes 90-ns apart. The spurious products of practical mixers and amplifiers make the aliased approach impractical due to high noise and distortion. By using a bandpass filter after the mixer, distortion is reduced. A processor built with a lower sideband filter method yielded the lowest distortion and noise. The lower sideband processor has a bandwidth of 2 to 42 MHz and can resolve echoes 60-ns apart. With a single-cycle tone-burst processor input, ringing in the IF filter causes temporal asymmetry of the output pulse, while ringing in the detector filter causes ringing in the output pulse. Performance is expected to improve through the design of optimized filters.

The FPGA controls the ultrasound transmission and ultrasound and photoacoustic data acquisition process of a customized 16-channel module that contains all of the necessary analog and digital circuits. The 16-channel module is one of multiple modules plugged into a motherboard; their beamformed outputs are made available for a digital signal processor (DSP) to access using an external memory interface (EMIF). The FPGA performs a key role through ultrafast reconfiguration and adaptation of its structure to allow real-time switching between the two imaging modes, including transmission control, laser synchronization, internal memory structure, beamforming, and EMIF structure and memory size. It performs another role by parallel accessing of internal memories and multi-thread processing to reduce the transfer of data and the processing load on the DSP. Furthermore, because the laser will be pulsing even during ultrasound pulse-echo acquisition, the FPGA ensures that the laser pulses are far enough from the pulse-echo acquisitions by appropriate time-division multiplexing (TDM).

Elastic skin properties are assessed applying suction to the skin surface with a stepwise increased vacuum and estimating the resulting displacements in a spatially resolved manner. Acquired radio frequency (R-F) echo signals and their envelope are analyzed for this purpose. A computer-controlled vacuum system with a digital pressure control loop was developed for precise and reproducible deformation. In a first processing step, the skin surface is segmented. Local axial strains inside the skin are estimated from axial displacements, which are estimated from consecutive echo signal frames analyzing the phase of the complex cross correlation function of analytical echo signals. Furthermore, speckle tracking is applied to estimate axial and lateral displacements and to quantify axial and lateral strains. The correlation coefficient of windowed echo signals compensated for displacements are used as a measure to validate the estimated strains, which is essential to accomplish reliable in vivo measurements. Phantom experiments were performed to validate the proposed technique. Results of in vivo measurements are presented, showing the potential for mechanical strain imaging in the skin in vivo.', u'issn': u'0885-3010', u'number': u'3', u'month': u'mar', u'volume': u'52', u'pages': u'375--385', u'file': u'IEEE Xplore Abstract Record:/home/kelu/Zotero/storage/BC8FRNFH/Vogt and Ermert - 2005 - Development and evaluation of a high-frequency ult.html:text/html', u'year': u'2005', 'ID': 'vogt_development_2005', u'journal': u'IEEE Transactions on Ultrasonics, Ferroelectrics, and Frequency Control'}, {u'doi': u'10.1109/ULTSYM.2001.991996', u'keyword': u'biomedical ultrasonics, Ultrasonic imaging, ultrasonic transducers, Ultrasonic transducers, image resolution, High-resolution imaging, Design optimization, frame rate, Actuators, skin, Skin, 8 bit, B-scan modes, blood flow, Blood flow, blood flow measurement, clinical versatility, eyelid, Eyelids, frame rates, Frequency estimation, hand-held scanhead, high frequency ultrasound scanner, high-resolution images, high-speed actuator, low mass transducer, M-mode modes, SNR, superficial structures, swept-scan imaging modes, System performance', u'author': u'Erickson, S. and Kruse, D. and Ferrara, K.', 'ENTRYTYPE': u'inproceedings', u'abstract': u'A new real-time high frequency ultrasound scanner has been developed to easily image superficial structures and estimate blood flow, with several major improvements.

In this system, we have integrated a high-speed actuator used in conjunction with a low mass transducer enclosed in a hand-held scanhead, which allows direct placement on the eyelid or skin. The design of this system is optimized for high frame rates and clinical versatility.

We propose a fully hardware-based processor dedicated to real-time ultrasonic signal processing, which incorporates a preprocessing core, a low-power memory, an interpolation unit, and a priority assignment unit. This Ph.D. thesis represents an important contribution towards the complete integration of an ultrasound preprocessing system within the probe and the implementation of a new type of wireless UMI device.  During the last two decades, several UMI system miniaturization approaches have been presented in the literature. Some Authors proposed their front-end circuit integration and introduced hardware-based ultrasound signal processing units based on new algorithms. Research efforts in this area are driven by the increasing industrial interest on miniaturized UMI devices and by the development of new applications that benefit from the miniaturization of this technology. Moreover, the increasing performance of programmable circuits, such as FPGA, offers appropriate characteristics for the implementation of new UMI systems.  Most UMI system architectures found in the literature are based in whole or in part on a software implementation that uses a central processing unit (CPU) or a digital signal processor (DSP). This software approach provides flexibility and facilitates the implementation of processing algorithms which are becoming ever more effective and complex. However, to provide real-time ultrasound image processing, these systems require high-power consumption or are too large for a complete system integration on a single chip (SoC).', u'author': u'L\\xe9vesque, Philippe', u'month': u'jan', u'link': u'https://publications.polymtl.ca/509/', u'file': u\"Full Text PDF:/home/kelu/Zotero/storage/QDB5UBXA/L\\xe9vesque - 2011 - Architecture d'un processeur d\\xe9di\\xe9 aux traitements.pdf:application/pdf;Snapshot:/home/kelu/Zotero/storage/QXWRTVTP/L\\xe9vesque - 2011 - Architecture d'un processeur d\\xe9di\\xe9 aux traitements.html:text/html\", u'year': u'2011', u'urldate': u'2018-01-19', 'ID': 'levesque_architecture_2011', u'type': u'phd', 'ENTRYTYPE': u'phdthesis'}, {u'doi': u'10.1109/ULTSYM.2013.0526', u'keyword': u'biomedical ultrasonics, image reconstruction, medical image processing, scan conversion, Ultrasonic imaging, graphics processing units, Imaging, smart phones, ultrasonic imaging, quadrature demodulation, patient diagnosis, application specific integrated circuits, application-specific integrated circuits, portable instruments, graphics processing unit, portable ultrasound imaging system, Smartphone, 850\\xd7800 image reconstruction, Androids, application process, application processors, ASIC approach, Band-pass filters, core functional blocks, core ultrasound B-mode image processing, core ultrasound B-mode signal processing, high-end Android smartphone, Humanoid robots, POC systems, Samsung Galaxy Note II, Smart phones, smartphone-based portable ultrasound imaging system, total execution time, ultrasound B-mode image reconstruction, well-defined targeted applications', u'shorttitle': u'Smartphone-based portable ultrasound imaging system', u'author': u'Kim, Kyu Cheol and Kim, Min Jae and Joo, Hyun Suk and Lee, Wooyoul and Yoon, Changhan and Song, Tai-Kyong and Yoo, Yangmo', 'ENTRYTYPE': u'inproceedings', u'abstract': u\"There is a growing need of portable ultrasound imaging systems since it can allow clinicians to access and diagnose a patient at the scene of an accident or at the patient's bedside due to their improved accessibility.

Sparse sample processing is used, as the echo signal for the image lines is reconstructed in 512 equidistant focal points along the line through its in-phase and quadrature components. That information is sufficient for presenting a B-mode image and creating a color flow map. The high sampling rate provides the necessary delay resolution for the focusing. The low channel data width (1-bit) makes it possible to construct a compact beamformer logic. The signal reconstruction is done using finite impulse response (FIR) filters, applied on selected bit sequences of the delta-sigma modulator output stream. The approach allows for a multichannel beamformer to fit in a single field programmable gate array (FPGA) device. A 32-channel beamformer is estimated to occupy 50\\\\% of the available logic resources in a commercially available midrange FPGA, and to be able to operate at 129 MHz.

The focus of this work was to develop an easy-to-use platform kit (hardware and software) for providing the community a complete experimental setup for ultrasound imaging at a low cost, without the need for expensive and non-modifiable specific equipment. The goal of this work resembles the needs of medical systems in the 80\\u2019s where analog techniques using single-sensor devices were prominent. To this end, two open-source, arduino-like modules have been developed for building a simple, yet complete, single-channel analog front-end system, where all the intermediary signals are readily accessible by the user. A single-channel architecture avoids the beamforming overhead, though it limits the quality of the captured image, and brings simplicity to the system. The modules were tested using re-purposed ultrasound mechanical probes, as well as non-medical transducers. Furthermore, different digital acquisition systems were utilized for providing the images of interest. The developed modules can also be used in Radio Frequency (RF) projects, non-destructive testing and control projects, as well as in low-cost medical imaging projects on non-living samples.', u'issn': u'2514-1708', u'number': u'1', u'month': u'mar', u'volume': u'1', u'link': u'http://openhardware.metajnl.com/articles/10.5334/joh.2/', u'author': u'Jonveaux, Luc', u'file': u'Snapshot:/home/kelu/Zotero/storage/7G5R53S8/Jonveaux - 2017 - Arduino-like development kit for single-element ul.html:text/html', u'year': u'2017', u'urldate': u'2018-01-19', u'keyword': u'electronics, imaging, modules, Ultrasound', u'journal': u'Journal of Open Hardware', 'ID': 'jonveaux_arduino-like_2017'}, {u'doi': u'10.1109/EMBC.2016.7591892', u'keyword': u'Array signal processing, biomedical ultrasonics, field programmable gate arrays, Field programmable gate arrays, Transducers, Ultrasonic imaging, ultrasonic imaging, Biomedical imaging, Hardware, nondestructive testing, 128-channel FPGA, analog front-end AFE5805, biomedical education, biomedical imaging processing algorithms, biomedical signal processing algorithms, biomedical students, commercial ultrasound scanners, MD2131 beamformer source driver, medical diagnostic applications, PC based ultrasound imaging system, research activities, teaching activities', u'author': u'Assef, A.

By means of its thermal or mechanical effects, HIFU is able to serve as a direct tool for tissue ablation, or an indirect moderating medium to manipulate microbubbles or perform heating (hyperthermia) for the purpose of targeted drug delivery. The development and testing of HIFU based phased arrays is favorable as their elements allow for individual phasing to steer and focus the beam. While FDA has already approved tissue ablation by HIFU for the treatment of uterine fibroids (2004) and pain from bone metastases (2012), development continues on other possible applications that are less forgiving of incomplete treatment, such as thermal necrosis of malignant masses.Ideally, each element, of such an array must have its own fully programmable electrical driving channel, which allows the control of delay, phase, and amplitude of the output from each element. To enable full control, each channel needs a waveform generator, an amplification device, and an impedance matching circuit between driver and acoustic element.Similar projects utilizing this approach to drive therapeutic arrays include a 512-channel therapy system which was built at the University of Michigan using low cost Field-Programmable Gate Arrays (FPGA) microcontroller and highly efficient MOSFET switching amplifiers [1]. However, this system lacks the ability to drive both, continuous wave (CW) and transient short duty-cycle high power pulses.This paper presents a hybrid system, which is able to perform CW and transient short duty-cycle high power excitation. In the following we will describe the design, programming, fabrication, and evaluation of this radiofrequency (RF) driver system as used in our laboratory for a 1.5 MHz center frequency, 298-element array (Imasonic SA, Besancon, France) [2], FPGA-controlled amplifier boards and matching circuitry.

Very recently, the discovery of compressive sensing has shown that the signal structure can be exploited to reduce the burden posed by traditional sensing requirements. In this spirit, we have designed a simple ultrasound imaging device that can perform three-dimensional imaging using just a single ultrasound sensor. Our device makes a compressed measurement of the spatial ultrasound field using a plastic aperture mask placed in front of the ultrasound sensor. The aperture mask ensures that every pixel in the image is uniquely identifiable in the compressed measurement. We demonstrate that this device can successfully image two structured objects placed in water. The need for just one sensor instead of thousands paves the way for cheaper, faster, simpler, and smaller sensing devices and possible new clinical applications.\\nCompressive 3D ultrasound imaging is possible with only one sensor and a simple aperture coding mask.\\nCompressive 3D ultrasound imaging is possible with only one sensor and a simple aperture coding mask.', u'issn': u'2375-2548', u'number': u'12', u'month': u'dec', u'volume': u'3', u'pages': u'e1701423', u'link': u'http://advances.sciencemag.org/content/3/12/e1701423', u'author': u'Kruizinga, Pieter and Meulen, Pim van der and Fedjajevs, Andrejs and Mastik, Frits and Springeling, Geert and Jong, Nico de and Bosch, Johannes G. and Leus, Geert', u'file': u'Snapshot:/home/kelu/Zotero/storage/GT29BZEC/Kruizinga et al. - 2017 - Compressive 3D ultrasound imaging using a single s.html:text/html', u'year': u'2017', u'urldate': u'2018-01-19', 'ID': 'kruizinga_compressive_2017', u'annote': u'Single-pixel ultrasound approach.\\nAwesome work with the mask.\\nTo be replicated =)', u'journal': u'Science Advances'}, {u'doi': u'10.1109/ULTSYM.2012.0542', u'keyword': u'array signal processing, biomedical ultrasonics, Field programmable gate arrays, Transducers, Ultrasonic imaging, Imaging, Real-time systems, Image resolution, Arrays, ultrasonic imaging, biological tissues, contrast-to-noise ratio, field programmable technology, flexible annular array imaging platform, imaging tool, microultrasound, multichannel dynamic beamforming technique, tissue phantom measurements', u'author': u'Qiu, W. and Yu, Y. and Chabok, H.

The transducer in ultrasound system was driven by a pulse train generator, which delivers high-voltage bipolar or unipolar pulse train. Several recent papers have discussed both the importance and the design of unipolar and bipolar pulse generator for ultrasound applications. Bipolar voltage pulse has lower unwanted DC and low-frequency component could decrease the leakage current. Also, its peak-to-peak pulse voltage could achieve twice of the voltage rating of the coaxial cable connecting the generator and the transducer. In current commercial ultrasound systems, bipolar pulse generators are commonly used; however, it still had some disadvantages like longer pulse length, which limited the driving frequency and affect the signal performance. This paper purposed a novel design of bipolar pulse generator based on a novel dual P-N channel MOSFET and FPGA timing control. It could produce multi-cycle pulses with center frequency over 50 MHz and shorter pulse length.

Instruments requiring huge data throughput and parallel computing use FPGA\\u2019s for data processing. The microcontroller in turn configures the application hardware devices such as FPGA\\u2019s, ADC\\u2019s and Ethernet chips etc. The interfacing of these devices uses address/data bus interface, serial interface or serial peripheral interface. The choice of the interface depends upon the input/output pins available with different devices, programming ease and proprietary interfaces supported by devices such as ADC\\u2019s. The novelty of this paper is to describe the programming logic used for various types of interface scenarios from microcontroller to different programmable devices. The study presented describes the methods and logic flowcharts for different interfaces. The implementation of the interface logics were in prototype hardware for ultrasound scanner. The internal devices were controlled from the graphical user interface in a laptop and the scan results are taken.

Current capsule endoscopes are dependent on visual manifestation of disease and limited in regards to transmural imaging and detection of deeper pathology. Ultrasound capsule endoscopy (USCE) has the potential to overcome surface only imaging and provide transmural scans of the GI tract.

In this work we propose the first fully-digital, single-chip 3D US imager on FPGA. The proposed design is a complete processing pipeline that includes pre-processing, image reconstruction, and post-processing. It supports up to 1024 input channels, which matches or exceeds state of the art, in an unprecedented estimated power budget of 6.1 W. The imager exploits a highly scalable architecture which can be either downscaled for 2D imaging, or further upscaled on a larger FPGA.

Currently, the communication of raw radio-frequency (RF) channel data from the probe to the computer for digital beamforming is a bottleneck. For reducing the amount of transferred data samples, this paper investigates the design of an adapted sparse sampling technique for image reconstruction inspired by the compressed sensing framework. Echo responses from isolated points are generated using a physically based simulation of ultrasound wave propagation through tissues. These point spread functions form a dictionary of shift-variant bent waves, which depend on the specific sound excitation and acquisition protocols. Speckled ultrasound images can be approximately decomposed in this dictionary where sparsity is enforced at the system matrix design. The Moore-Penrose pseudoinverse is precomputed and used at the reconstruction stage for fast minimum-norm recovery from nonuniform pseudorandom sampled raw RF data.

We hypothesize that, by collecting synthetic aperture data sets over a range of aperture positions while precisely tracking the position and orientation of the transducer, we can synthesize large effective apertures to produce images with improved resolution and target detectability. We analyze the two largest limiting factors for coherent signal summation: aberration and mechanical uncertainty. Using an excised canine abdominal wall as a model phase screen, we experimentally observed an effective arrival time error ranging from 18.3 ns to 58 ns (root-mean-square error) across the swept positions. Through this clutter-generating tissue, we observed a 72.9\\\\% improvement in resolution with only a 3.75 dB increase in side lobe amplitude compared to the control case. We present a simulation model to study the effect of calibration and mechanical jitter errors on the synthesized point spread function. The relative effects of these errors in each imaging dimension are explored, showing the importance of orientation relative to the point spread function.

Method: Modern ultrasound scanners typically employ a high element count transducer array with multichannel transmit and receive electronics. To minimize hardware costs, we employ a single piezoelectric element, mechanically swept across the target scene, and a highly cost-engineered single channel acquisition circuit. Given this constraint, we compare the achievable image quality of a monostatic fixed focus scanner (MFFS) with a monostatic synthetic aperture scanner (MSAS) using postfocusing. Quantitative analysis of image quality was carried out using simulation and phantom experiments, which were used to compare a proof-of-concept MSAS prototype with an MFFS device currently available on the market. Finally, in vivo experiments were performed to validate the MSAS prototype in obstetric imaging. Results: Simulations show that the achievable lateral resolution of the MSAS approach is superior at all ranges compared to the fixed focus approach. Phantom experiments verify the improved resolution of the MSAS prototype but reveal a lower signal to noise ratio. In vivo experiments show promising results using the MSAS for clinical diagnostics in prenatal care. Conclusion: The proposed MSAS achieves superior resolution but lower SNR compared to an MFFS approach, principally due to lower acoustic energy emitted. Significance : The production costs of the proposed MSAS could be an order of magnitude lower than any other ultrasound system on the market today, bringing affordable obstetric imaging a step closer for developing countries.', u'issn': u'1932-4545', u'number': u'4', u'month': u'aug', u'volume': u'11', u'pages': u'849--857', u'file': u'IEEE Xplore Abstract Record:/home/kelu/Zotero/storage/QK5H675X/Heuvel et al. - 2017 - Development of a Low-Cost Medical Ultrasound Scann.html:text/html;IEEE Xplore Full Text PDF:/home/kelu/Zotero/storage/V355HKZ8/Heuvel et al. - 2017 - Development of a Low-Cost Medical Ultrasound Scann.pdf:application/pdf', u'year': u'2017', 'ID': 'heuvel_development_2017', u'journal': u'IEEE Transactions on Biomedical Circuits and Systems'}, {u'doi': u'10.1007/s11548-018-1729-3', u'author': u'Degirmenci, Alperen and Perrin, Douglas P. and Howe, Robert D.', u'language': u'en', u'title': u'High dynamic range ultrasound imaging', 'ENTRYTYPE': u'article', u'abstract': u'Purpose High dynamic range (HDR) imaging is a popular computational photography technique that has found its way into every modern smartphone and camera.

To preserve the axial resolution, a pulse compression (PC) is performed by applying a matched filter based on the transmit code. However, the conventional PC method requires a few hundred filter coefficients when compressing elongated code (e.g., chirp) into a short pulse, yielding to considerably high computational complexity. In this paper, an efficient PC method of chirp coded excitation is proposed to lower the complexity burden. In the proposed method, the PC is conducted with the decimated complex baseband data instead of a beamformed radio-frequency (RF) data. Although compression is applied with the complex data, a total computational complexity is reduced by a factor of 4 L2 since L-fold decimation is performed to reduce both data and the number of filter coefficients. The proposed method was evaluated with the phantom study. For quantitative comparison, the -6dB axial resolution for 15 wire targets and the clutter-energy-to-total-energy ratios (CTRs) at a hypo-echoic region were measured. CTR were 27.6 dB and 27.4 dB for the conventional and proposed PC methods, respectively.

In this paper, we propose a new dynamic CBB PC method ( that can improve the SNR while compensating for tissue attenuation. The compression filter coefficients in the method are generated by dynamically changing the demodulation frequencies along with the depth. For PC, the obtained coefficients are independently applied to the in-phase and quadrature components of the CBB data. To evaluate the performance of the proposed method, simulation, phantom, and in vivo studies were conducted, and all three studies showed improved SNR, i.e., maximally 3.87, 7.41, and 5.75 dB, respectively. In addition, the measured peak range sidelobe level of the proposed method yielded lower values than the and , and it also derived a suitable target location, i.e., a {\\\\textless}0.07-mm target location error, while maintaining the axial resolution. In an in vivo abdominal experiment, the method depicted brighter and clearer features in the hyperechoic region because highly correlated signals were produced by compensating for tissue attenuation.

Second, most pipelines are implemented in special hardware, resulting in limited flexibility of implemented processing steps on such platforms. Methods: With SUPRA we propose an open-source pipeline for fully Software Defined Ultrasound Processing for Real-time Applications to alleviate these problems. Covering all steps from beamforming to output of B-mode images, SUPRA can help improve the reproducibility of results and make modifications to the image acquisition mode accessible to the research community. We evaluate the pipeline qualitatively, quantitatively, and regarding its run-time. Results: The pipeline shows image quality comparable to a clinical system and backed by point-spread function measurements a comparable resolution. Including all processing stages of a usual ultrasound pipeline, the run-time analysis shows that it can be executed in 2D and 3D on consumer GPUs in real-time. Conclusions: Our software ultrasound pipeline opens up the research in image acquisition. Given access to ultrasound data from early stages (raw channel data, radiofrequency data) it simplifies the development in imaging. Furthermore, it tackles the reproducibility of research results, as code can be shared easily and even be executed without dedicated ultrasound hardware.', u'issn': u'1861-6410, 1861-6429', u'month': u'mar', u'note': u'arXiv: 1711.06127', u'link': u'http://arxiv.org/abs/1711.06127', u'keyword': u'Computer Science - Computer Vision and Pattern Recognition, Computer Science - Distributed, Parallel, and Cluster Computing', u'year': u'2018', u'urldate': u'2018-05-24', 'ID': 'gobl_supra:_2018', u'journal': u'International Journal of Computer Assisted Radiology and Surgery'}, {u'doi': u'10.1504/IJIT.2018.090859', u'author': u'Raj, J.

Advances in separating the signals produced from contrast agents versus surrounding tissue backscatter provide unique opportunities for specialized sensors designed to image microbubbles with higher signal to noise and resolution than previously possible. In this review article, we describe the background principles and recent developments of ultrasound transducer technology for receiving signals produced by contrast agents while rejecting signals arising from soft tissue.

Both methods perform almost identically for simulated scatterers and give a significant improvement in azimuth resolution and a constant resolution in elevation. Side lobes below -60 dB are achievable for both methods. Validation of the method is achieved by scanning a simple wire phantom and a complex phantom containing wires in azimuth and elevation. The simple wire phantom shows the same results as that found through simulation. The complex phantom shows simultaneous focusing in azimuth and elevation for the wire scatterers.
