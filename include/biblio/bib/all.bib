	abstract = {In medical ultrasound scanning, coaxial cables connects the transducer elements to the computing platforms. During scanning, these probes are hanging from sonographer hand and slides on the patient body providing discomfort for both patient and sonographer. To address this issue, we discussed the feasibility of realizing wireless ultrasound transducer and as a proof of concept we built the prototype of wireless ultrasound transducer based scanning system. The proposed system has two parts: wireless transducer with embedded pre-processing unit, and back-end module for image reconstruction and display purpose. The embedded pre-processing unit consist of analog and digital integrated circuits, transmit beamforming, low noise amplification, time gain compensation and receive beam forming. The output of wireless transducer is scanline data, which is transmitted to back-end module via wireless communication transceiver. The complete back-end module is implemented on a Zedboard platform which comes with FPGA and ARM processor. The signal processing algorithms, which include envelope detection, log compression, scan conversion, interpolation and decimation algorithms are implemented on FPGA, while ARM processor is used to control and coordinate between signal processing modules. The Wi-Fi 802.11n standard is used as a wireless communication transceiver between wireless transducer and back-end module. The wireless transducer prototype is designed for 64 element, 8 channel linear transducer. The proposed prototype of wireless transducer based scanning system is successfully tested by scanning a phantom.},

	abstract = {Mobile and cost effective ultrasound devices are used in point of care scenarios or the drama room. To reduce the costs of such devices we already presented the possibilities of consumer devices like the Apple iPad for full signal processing of raw data for ultrasound image generation. Emerging technologies like ultrafast ultrasound imaging result in new algorithms for example for shearwave elastography or vector velocity imaging but also enable the creation of a full image with only one excitation/reception event based on plane wave imaging. This way acquisition times and power consumption of ultrasound imaging can be reduced for low power mobile devices based on consumer electronics realizing the transition from FPGA or ASIC based beamforming into more flexible software beamforming. This is usually performed on a GPU utilizing massive parallel processing (like CUDA or OpenCL) but with the development of modern processors (A7, A8 and A8X) for its smartphones and tablets Apple introduced parallel GPU hardware and the framework “Metal” for advanced graphics and general purpose GPU processing for the iOS platform. We use it for medical signal reconstruction in the mobile plane wave beamforming and imaging on ultrasound channel data sets measured with our research systems “DiPhAS” in ultrafast imaging mode. We were able to integrate the beamforming reconstruction into our mobile ultrasound processing application on the iOS platform. The next step into realizing a mobile, fully software based ultrasound system was made. The beamforming can be performed at up to 62 Hz at reasonable image quality on iPad Air 2 hardware providing real time imaging including the post-processing of beamformed data into images (envelope detection and scan conversion).},

Each system presents specific performance in terms of number of channels, flexibility, processing power, data storage capability, and overall dimensions. This paper reports the design criteria and hardware/software implementation details of a new 256-channel ultrasound advanced open platform. This system is organized in a modular architecture, including multiple front-end boards, interconnected by a high-speed (80 Gb/s) ring, capable of finely controlling all transmit (TX) and receive (RX) signals. High flexibility and processing power (equivalent to 2500 GFLOP) are guaranteed by the possibility of individually programming multiple digital signal processors and field programmable gate arrays. Eighty GB of on-board memory are available for the storage of prebeamforming, postbeamforming, and baseband data. The use of latest generation devices allowed to integrate all needed electronics in a small size (34 cm×30 cm×26 cm). The system implements a multiline beamformer that allows obtaining images of 96 lines by 2048 depths at a frame rate of 720 Hz (expandable to 3000 Hz). The multiline beamforming capability is also exploited to implement a real-time vector Doppler scheme in which a single TX and two independent RX apertures are simultaneously used to maintain the analysis over a full pulse repetition frequency range.},

	abstract = {In this paper, a system-level design is presented for an integrated receive circuit for a wireless ultrasound probe, which includes analog front ends and beamformation modules. This paper focuses on the investigation of the effects of architectural design choices on the image quality. The point spread function is simulated in Field II from 10 to 160 mm using a convex array transducer. A noise analysis is performed, and the minimum signal-to-noise ratio (SNR) requirements are derived for the low-noise amplifiers (LNAs) and A/D converters (ADCs) to fulfill the design specifications of a dynamic range of 60 dB and a penetration depth of 160 mm in the B-mode image. Six front-end implementations are compared using Nyquist-rate and Σ∆ modulator ADCs. The image quality is evaluated as a function of the depth in terms of lateral full-width at half-maximum (FWHM) and -12-dB cystic resolution (CR). The designs that minimally satisfy the specifications are based on an 8-b 30-MSPS Nyquist converter and a single-bit third-order 240-MSPS Σ∆ modulator, with an SNR for the LNA in both cases equal to 64 dB. The mean lateral FWHM and CR are 2.4\% and 7.1\% lower for the Σ∆ architecture compared with the Nyquist-rate one. However, the results generally show minimal differences between equivalent architectures. Advantages and drawbacks are finally discussed for the two families of converters.},

The transducer samples a 3-D volume by simultaneous rotation and translation, giving a helical motion. Two different 3-D SAF methods are investigated, a direct and a two-step approach. Both methods perform almost identically for simulated scatterers and give a significant improvement in azimuth resolution and a constant resolution in elevation. Side lobes below -60 dB are achievable for both methods. Validation of the method is achieved by scanning a simple wire phantom and a complex phantom containing wires in azimuth and elevation. The simple wire phantom shows the same results as that found through simulation. The complex phantom shows simultaneous focusing in azimuth and elevation for the wire scatterers. Consideration of the processing requirements for both 3-D SAF methods shows that the two-step approach can give equivalent performance using an order of magnitude fewer calculations. This reduction requires a temporary storage of 9.1 GB of data for the investigated setup.},

The proposed synthetic aperture method offers good dynamical resolution along with fast numerical reconstruction. In this study complex object data were recorded coherently in a two-dimensional hologram using a 3.5 MHz single transducer with a fairly wide-angle beam. Image reconstruction which applies the wavefront backward propagation method and the near-field curvature compensation was performed numerically in a microcomputer using the spatial frequency domain. This approach allows an efficient use of the FFT-algorithms. Because of the simple and fast scanning scheme and the efficient reconstruction algorithms the method can be made real-time. The image quality of the proposed method was studied by evaluating the spatial and dynamical resolution in a waterbath and in a typical tissue-mimicking phantom. The lateral as well as the range resolution (-6 dB) were approximately 1 mm in the depth range of 30-100 mm. The dynamical resolution could be improved considerably when the beam width was made narrower. Although it resulted in a slightly reduced spatial resolution this compromise has to be done for better resolution of low-contrast targets such as cysts. The study showed that cysts as small as 2 mm by diameter could be resolved.{\textless}{\textgreater}},

We hypothesize that, by collecting synthetic aperture data sets over a range of aperture positions while precisely tracking the position and orientation of the transducer, we can synthesize large effective apertures to produce images with improved resolution and target detectability. We analyze the two largest limiting factors for coherent signal summation: aberration and mechanical uncertainty. Using an excised canine abdominal wall as a model phase screen, we experimentally observed an effective arrival time error ranging from 18.3 ns to 58 ns (root-mean-square error) across the swept positions. Through this clutter-generating tissue, we observed a 72.9\% improvement in resolution with only a 3.75 dB increase in side lobe amplitude compared to the control case. We present a simulation model to study the effect of calibration and mechanical jitter errors on the synthesized point spread function. The relative effects of these errors in each imaging dimension are explored, showing the importance of orientation relative to the point spread function. We present a prototype device for performing swept synthetic aperture imaging using a conventional 1-D array transducer and ultrasound research scanner. Point target reconstruction error for a 44.2 degree sweep shows a reconstruction precision of 82.8 μm and 17.8 μm in the lateral and axial dimensions respectively, within the acceptable performance bounds of the simulation model.

Recently, several hand-held echo devices are going on market and they are expected to play a role as "visible" auscultation instead of stethoscope. We have developed a portable and inexpensive echo device which can be used for screening of cardiac function. Two single element transducers were attached 180 degrees apart to a rotor with 14-mm diameter. The mechanical scanner, integrated circuits for transmitting and receiving ultrasonic signals and an A/D converter were encapsulated in a 150 x 40 mm probe weighing 200 g. The scan was started and the image was displayed on a Windows based personal computer (PC) as soon as the probe was connected to USB 2.0 port of the PC. The central frequency was available between 2.5 and 7.5 MHz, the image depth was 15 cm and the frame rate was 30/s. The estimated price of this ultra-portable ultrasound is about 3000 US dollars with software. For 69 cardiac patients with informed consent, image quality was compared with those obtained with basic range diagnostic echo machines. Left ventricular ejection fraction (EF) derived from normal M-mode image of standard machines (EFm) were compared with visual EF of the ultra-portable ultrasound device (EFv). The image quality was comparable to the basic range diagnostic echo machines although short axis view of aortic root was not clearly visualized because the probe was too large for intercostal approach. EFv agreed well with EFm. The ultra-portable ultrasound may provide useful information on screening and health care.},

	abstract = {Ultrasound imaging is an effective tool for identifying maternal mortality risk factors. Unfortunately, ultrasound is nearly absent in many rural healthcare facilities in developing regions due to the high costs of both equipment and required training. To leverage existing healthcare systems commonly found in these contexts, we have focused our efforts on increasing the diagnostic capabilities of midwives -- often central medical figures in rural and low-income communities. We have designed and built a low-cost portable ultrasound device consisting of a USB ultrasound probe and a touchscreen netbook for a total cost of around USD3500. Compared to currently available ultrasound devices, we simplified the user interface while maintaining functionality to allow midwives to detect three common obstetrical conditions: placenta previa, multiple gestations, and breech presentation. To evaluate our solution, we tested the accuracy of ultrasound measurements, image quality, and whether midwives could use ultrasound. Testing performed by nine clinicians indicated our device would be appropriate for identifying the three conditions. Our modular design approach allows for easy modification, and the device is designed to utilize existing local healthcare resources in order to create a sustainable solution that does not depend on continuous foreign assistance.},

	abstract = {Recently there have been major advances in the electro-mechanical design of upper extremity prosthetics. However, the development of control strategies for such prosthetics has lagged significantly behind. Conventional noninvasive myoelectric control strategies rely on the amplitude of electromyography (EMG) signals from flexor and extensor muscles in the forearm. Surface EMG has limited specificity for deep contiguous muscles because of cross talk and cannot reliably differentiate between individual digit and joint motions. We present a novel ultrasound imaging based control strategy for upper arm prosthetics that can overcome many of the limitations of myoelectric control. Real time ultrasound images of the forearm muscles were obtained using a wearable mechanically scanned single element ultrasound system, and analyzed to create maps of muscle activity based on changes in the ultrasound echogenicity of the muscle during contraction. Individual digit movements were associated with unique maps of activity. These maps were correlated with previously acquired training data to classify individual digit movements. Preliminary results using ten healthy volunteers demonstrated this approach could provide robust classification of individual finger movements with 98\% accuracy (precision 96\%-100\% and recall 97\%-100\% for individual finger flexions). The change in ultrasound echogenicity was found to be proportional to the digit flexion speed (R2=0.9), and thus our proposed strategy provided a proportional signal that can be used for fine control. We anticipate that ultrasound imaging based control strategies could be a significant improvement over conventional myoelectric control of prosthetics.},

USB 2.0 is a half-duplex bus running at 480 Mb/s and each peripheral can draw as much as 500 mA of current at a nominal 5 V from the USB connector. We have developed a family of USB-based, B-mode probes that connect directly to a personal computer or laptop and that draw as little as 250 mA (1.25 W) when forming ten 5 MHz images/second. The pulser/receiver, high voltage supply, analog-to-digital converter, servo and USB interface are implemented on a small circuit board inside the probe body. After raw data are transferred to the computer, gain compensation, interpolation, filtering and other data processing are performed by the host processor. This gives flexibility to developers and allows enhancements to the system to be incorporated via software updates. In addition, the raw data are available for storage and later postprocessing. There are several advantages to this architectural approach to B-mode imaging, including low cost, portability and optimal signal-to-noise performance. This paper describes the advantages of the architecture of the probe family, discusses the hardware/software division of the required processing steps and presents example images from a 12.5 MHz ophthalmic probe.},

The only other option is to buy needed equipment and experimental setups from specialized manufactures. The latter option is not feasible the departments in developing countries where funding for education and research is scarce and very limited as equipments from these manufactures are typically too expensive.

The FWHM has, however, been shown to sometimes provide misleading information about systems. The concept of "cystic resolution" in which performance is quantified as the size of the void that produces a specified contrast, has been previously introduced to medical ultrasound. We extend the concept and develop a general metric to analyze the 3D broadband performance of arbitrary ultrasound systems. We provide an example of application in which we compare the performance of a conventional system using a 1D array and time delay beamforming of radiofrequency (RF) data to that of a system based on a 2D array that focuses solely via phase rotation of complex I/Q data formed by directly sampling the received RF signal.},

Phased-array techniques are not practically applicable at such a high frequency, due to the too small size required for the single transducer element, and mechanical scanning is the only practical alternative. At present, all ophthalmic ultrasound systems use focused single-element, mechanically scanned probes. A good probe positioning and image evaluation feedback requires an image refresh-rate of about 15-30 frames per second, which is achieved in commercial mechanical scanning probes by using electromagnetic motors. In this work, we report the design, construction, and experimental characterization of the first mechanical scanning probe for ophthalmic echography based on a small piezoelectric ultrasound motor. The prototype probe reaches a scanning rate of 15 sectors per second, with very silent operation and little weight. The first high-frequency echographic images obtained with the prototype probe are presented.},

	abstract = {Spatial resolution in modern ultrasound imaging systems is limited by the high cost of large aperture transducer arrays, which require a large number of transducer elements and electronic channels. A new technique to enhance the spatial resolution of pulse-echo imaging systems is presented. The method attempts to build an image that could be obtained with a transducer array aperture larger than that physically available. We consider two images of the same object obtained with two different apertures, the full aperture and a subaperture, of the same transducer. A suitable artificial neural network (ANN) is trained to reproduce the relationship between the image obtained with the transducer full aperture and the image obtained with a subaperture. The inputs of the neural network are portions of the image obtained with the subaperture (low resolution image), and the target outputs are the corresponding portions of the image produced by the full aperture (high resolution image). After the network is trained, it can produce images with almost the same resolution of the full aperture transducer, but using a reduced number of real transducer elements. All computations are carried out on envelope-detected decimated images; for this reason, the computational cost is low and the method is suitable for real-time applications. The proposed method was applied to experimental data obtained with the ultrasound synthetic aperture focusing technique (SAFT), giving quite promising results. Realtime implementation on a modern, full-digital echographic system is currently being developed.},

It is also possible to assure reduced bias and uncertainty in critical TOF measurements, such as those involving low signal-to-noise ratio (SNR) as well as severe distortion of echo shape. A number of numerical tests are conducted on simulated signals with the aim of highlighting the good performance of the method when operating in critical conditions; to reduce the computational burden without losing significance in the analysis, a statistical experimental design-based technique is enlisted.

Analytic signal processing is used to improve pulse resolution. A real-time analytic processor was built using single-sideband (SBB) AM techniques.

This processor has a transducer bandwidth of 0.5 to 20 MHz and can resolve echoes 90-ns apart. The spurious products of practical mixers and amplifiers make the aliased approach impractical due to high noise and distortion. By using a bandpass filter after the mixer, distortion is reduced. A processor built with a lower sideband filter method yielded the lowest distortion and noise. The lower sideband processor has a bandwidth of 2 to 42 MHz and can resolve echoes 60-ns apart. With a single-cycle tone-burst processor input, ringing in the IF filter causes temporal asymmetry of the output pulse, while ringing in the detector filter causes ringing in the output pulse. Performance is expected to improve through the design of optimized filters. The ringing is less with ultrasonic echoes, because they do not start and stop as abruptly as a tone burst},

The presented architecture combines 2 finite impulse response (FIR) filters to process in-phase and quadrature signals and includes a piecewise linear approximation architecture that performs the required square root operations. The proposed implementation enables flexibility to support different transducers with its ability to load on-the-fly different FIR filter coefficient sets. The complexity and accuracy of the demodulator processor are analyzed with simulated RF data; a normalized residual sum-of-squares cost function is used for comparison with the Matlab Hilbert function. Three implementations are integrated into a hand-held ultrasound system for experimental accuracy and performance evaluation. Real-time images were acquired from a reference phantom, demonstrating the feasibility of using the presented architecture to perform real-time digital quadrature demodulation of ultrasonic signal echoes. Experimental results show that the implementation, using only 2942 slices and 3 dedicated digital multipliers of a low-cost and low-power field-programmable gate array (FPGA) is accurate relative to a comparable software- based system; axial and lateral resolution of 1 mm and 2 mm, respectively, were obtained with a 12-mm piezoelectric transducer without postprocessing. Because the processing and sampling rates are the same, high-frequency ultrasound signals can be processed as well. For a 15-frame-per-second display, the hand-held ultrasonic imaging-processing core (FPGA, memory) requires only 45 mW (dynamic) when using a 5-MHz single-element piezoelectric transducer.},

The execution time was measured by examining the time stamp produced by a CIDA timer. For generating a 800×600 ultrasound B-mode image, it takes 18.32 ms for single-beam based ultrasound processing with the acquisition time of 19.7 ms.

	abstract = {High-frequency ultrasound imaging (at {\textgreater}20 MHz) has gained widespread attention due to its high spatial resolution being useful for basic cardiovascular and cancer research involving small animals. The sampling rate of the analog-to-digital converter in a high-frequency ultrasound system usually needs to be higher than 120 MHz in order to satisfy the Nyquist sampling-rate requirement. However, the sampling rate is typically within the range of 40-60 MHz in a traditional ultrasound system, and so we propose a delayed-excitation method for performing high-frequency ultrasound imaging with a traditional data acquisition scheme. In this method, the transmitted pulse is delayed by a certain time period so that the ultrasound echo data are aligned into high-sampling-rate slots. Wire and tissue-mimicking phantoms were imaged to evaluate the performance of the proposed method, whereas a porcine small-intestine specimen and an excised rabbit eyeball were used for in vitro imaging evaluations. The test results demonstrate that the proposed method allows high-frequency ultrasound imaging to be implemented using a traditional ultrasound sampling system.},

The FPGA is used to control, acquire, store, delay-and-sum, and transfer the data for real-time co-registered imaging. The FPGA controls the ultrasound transmission and ultrasound and photoacoustic data acquisition process of a customized 16-channel module that contains all of the necessary analog and digital circuits. The 16-channel module is one of multiple modules plugged into a motherboard; their beamformed outputs are made available for a digital signal processor (DSP) to access using an external memory interface (EMIF). The FPGA performs a key role through ultrafast reconfiguration and adaptation of its structure to allow real-time switching between the two imaging modes, including transmission control, laser synchronization, internal memory structure, beamforming, and EMIF structure and memory size. It performs another role by parallel accessing of internal memories and multi-thread processing to reduce the transfer of data and the processing load on the DSP. Furthermore, because the laser will be pulsing even during ultrasound pulse-echo acquisition, the FPGA ensures that the laser pulses are far enough from the pulse-echo acquisitions by appropriate time-division multiplexing (TDM). A co-registered ultrasound and photoacoustic imaging system consisting of four FPGA modules (64-channels) is constructed, and its performance is demonstrated using phantom targets and in vivo mouse tumor models.},

This array based pulsed-wave Doppler system included a 16-channel HF analog beamformer, a HF pulsed-wave Doppler module, timing circuits, HF bipolar pulsers, and analog front-ends. The beamformed echoes acquired by the 16 channel analog beamformer, were directly fed to the HF pulsed-wave Doppler module. Then the in-phase and quadrature-phase (IQ) audio Doppler signals were digitized by either a sound card or a Gage digitizer and stored in a PC. The Doppler spectrogram was displayed on a PC in real time. The two-way beam-widths were determined to be 160 μm to 320 μm when the array was electronically focused at different focal points at depths from 5–10 mm. A micro flow phantom, consisting of a polyimide tube with inner diameter of 127 μm, and the wire phantom were used to evaluate and calibrate the system. The results show that the system is capable of detecting motion velocity of the wire phantom as low as 0.1 mm/s, and detecting blood-mimicking flow velocity in the 127 μm tube lower than 7 mm/s. The system was subsequently used to measure the blood flow in vivo in two mouse abdominal superficial vessels with diameters of approximately 200 μm, and a mouse aorta close to the heart. These results demonstrated that this system may become an indispensable part of the current HF array based imaging systems for small animal studies.},

	abstract = {The elastic properties of skin are of great interest in dermatology because they are affected by many pathological conditions. In this paper, a technique for in vivo mechanical strain imaging of the skin based on high-frequency ultrasound (HFUS) is presented. Elastic skin properties are assessed applying suction to the skin surface with a stepwise increased vacuum and estimating the resulting displacements in a spatially resolved manner. Acquired radio frequency (R-F) echo signals and their envelope are analyzed for this purpose. A computer-controlled vacuum system with a digital pressure control loop was developed for precise and reproducible deformation. In a first processing step, the skin surface is segmented. Local axial strains inside the skin are estimated from axial displacements, which are estimated from consecutive echo signal frames analyzing the phase of the complex cross correlation function of analytical echo signals. Furthermore, speckle tracking is applied to estimate axial and lateral displacements and to quantify axial and lateral strains. The correlation coefficient of windowed echo signals compensated for displacements are used as a measure to validate the estimated strains, which is essential to accomplish reliable in vivo measurements. Phantom experiments were performed to validate the proposed technique. Results of in vivo measurements are presented, showing the potential for mechanical strain imaging in the skin in vivo.},

	abstract = {A new real-time high frequency ultrasound scanner has been developed to easily image superficial structures and estimate blood flow, with several major improvements. A great limitation of previous high frequency systems has been the requirement to water-couple the mechanically-scanned transducer to the object to be imaged, and slowly scan the transducer using a fixed motion system. In this system, we have integrated a high-speed actuator used in conjunction with a low mass transducer enclosed in a hand-held scanhead, which allows direct placement on the eyelid or skin. The design of this system is optimized for high frame rates and clinical versatility. Implemented on this system are B-scan, M-mode, and swept-scan imaging modes, with velocity estimation in the latter two. A series of experiments were performed to characterize system performance. The system provides a frame rate of 10 fps, which is partially limited by the execution time of the software. Phantom images from the scanner have 8-bit resolution with a SNR in excess of 35 dB, providing sharp, high-resolution images},

As previous designs have utilized costly electromagnetic motors, for the mechanical scanning translation, this mechanical scanning mechanism provides a highly simplified alternative. The mechanical scanning mechanism utilizes a single piezoelectric bimorph as the actuating element. Laser Doppler analysis of the transducer motion has shown that transducer deflections greater than 10 mm can be obtained for a large range of frequencies, from 40 to 120 Hz. This, in turn, results in a maximum theoretical frame rate of 240 fps. Peak deflections greater than 20 mm can be obtained at the scanning mechanism resonance (110 Hz). Additionally, an analysis of the transducer phase relative to the input voltage has shown that high phase stability (+/- 1.4 degrees) potentially eliminates the need for position encoders, further reducing the device complexity and cost.},

DSIQ beamforming is a low cost approach that relies on phase rotation of in-phase/quadrature (I/Q) data to implement focusing. The I/Q data are generated by directly sampling the received radio frequency (RF) signal, rather than through conventional baseband demodulation. We describe our efficient hardware implementation of the beamformer, which results in significant reductions in beamformer size and cost. We also present the results of experiments and simulations that compare the DSIQ beamformer to more conventional approaches, namely time delay beamforming and traditional complex demodulated I/Q beamforming. Results that show the effect of an error in the direct sampling process, as well as dependence on signal bandwidth and system f number (f\#) are presented. These results indicate that the image quality and robustness of the DSIQ beamformer are adequate for routine applications.},

La littérature des deux dernières décennies présente diverses approches visant à miniaturiser la technologie de l’IMU. Plusieurs auteurs proposent des solutions en matière d’intégration des circuits frontaux ou de matérialisation de nouveaux algorithmes de traitement des signaux ultrasoniques. Les efforts de recherche dans ce domaine sont propulsés par l’intérêt grandissant des marchés et par le développement de nouvelles applications qui bénéficient de la miniaturisation de cette technologie. De plus, les performances grandissantes des circuits intégrés programmables tels que les FPGA offrent les caractéristiques appropriées pour la mise en œuvre de nouveaux systèmes d’IMU.----------ABSTRACT
This Ph.D. thesis is related to the design of a new architecture of ultrasound medical imaging (UMI) system. We propose a fully hardware-based processor dedicated to real-time ultrasonic signal processing, which incorporates a preprocessing core, a low-power memory, an interpolation unit, and a priority assignment unit. This Ph.D. thesis represents an important contribution towards the complete integration of an ultrasound preprocessing system within the probe and the implementation of a new type of wireless UMI device.  During the last two decades, several UMI system miniaturization approaches have been presented in the literature. Some Authors proposed their front-end circuit integration and introduced hardware-based ultrasound signal processing units based on new algorithms. Research efforts in this area are driven by the increasing industrial interest on miniaturized UMI devices and by the development of new applications that benefit from the miniaturization of this technology. Moreover, the increasing performance of programmable circuits, such as FPGA, offers appropriate characteristics for the implementation of new UMI systems.  Most UMI system architectures found in the literature are based in whole or in part on a software implementation that uses a central processing unit (CPU) or a digital signal processor (DSP). This software approach provides flexibility and facilitates the implementation of processing algorithms which are becoming ever more effective and complex. However, to provide real-time ultrasound image processing, these systems require high-power consumption or are too large for a complete system integration on a single chip (SoC).},

However, the ultrasound transmitter module in these systems has limited access to medical ultrasound researchers. In this paper, we have presented the development of a programmable architecture for 8-channel ultrasound transmitter for medical ultrasound research activities. The proposed architecture consists of 8 transmit channels and Field Programmable Gate Array (FPGA) based configurable delay profile to steer acoustic beam, transmit frequency and pulse pattern length depending on the medical application. Our system operates in pulse-echo mode, with ultrasound transmit frequency up to 20 MHz, excitation voltage up to 100 Vpp, and individual channel control with single high speed Serial Peripheral Interface (SPI).

	abstract = {A compact medical ultrasound beamformer architecture that uses oversampled 1-bit analog-to-digital (A/D) converters is presented. Sparse sample processing is used, as the echo signal for the image lines is reconstructed in 512 equidistant focal points along the line through its in-phase and quadrature components. That information is sufficient for presenting a B-mode image and creating a color flow map. The high sampling rate provides the necessary delay resolution for the focusing. The low channel data width (1-bit) makes it possible to construct a compact beamformer logic. The signal reconstruction is done using finite impulse response (FIR) filters, applied on selected bit sequences of the delta-sigma modulator output stream. The approach allows for a multichannel beamformer to fit in a single field programmable gate array (FPGA) device. A 32-channel beamformer is estimated to occupy 50\% of the available logic resources in a commercially available midrange FPGA, and to be able to operate at 129 MHz. Simulation of the architecture at 140 MHz provides images with a dynamic range approaching 60 dB for an excitation frequency of 3 MHz.},

To achieve these goals, Teratech leveraged its unique silicon system-on-a-chip capability, and dramatically reduced the typical rack-mounted conventional system to a Terason SmartProbeTM weighing approximately 10 ounces (0.28 kg). Employing Teratech's proprietary charge domain processing, the beamformer supports a continuous computation throughput of 10.2 billion operations/s and a delay update rate of 10 billion bits/s while consuming less than 1 W, providing more than 10-fold savings in power and weight compared to the conventional implementation.

	abstract = {The applications of ultrasound in medicine have been increasing in the last decade either in diagnostics or in treatments. Ultrasound is routinely used in clinical examinations, such as pregnancy exams. On the other hand, a typical ultrasound system costs somewhere between 100k\$ to 250k\$ because of its (1) expensive ultrasound transducers, (2) large driving electronics, (3) processing and visualization units. High cost and large volume of the ultrasound systems prevent even wider usage of these systems. It is possible to extent the use of ultrasound in clinic environment like a stethoscope, if the size and cost had been reduced orders of magnitude. The aim of this work is to develop an ultraportable and very low cost diagnostic ultrasound imaging probe; by combining inertial sensors with the probes. The manual motion of the probe by the operator's hand movement enables scanning. The position of the probe is tracked using inertial sensors. Finally, the acoustic reflections are registered together by the help of position information of the probe to form an image.},

The focus of this work was to develop an easy-to-use platform kit (hardware and software) for providing the community a complete experimental setup for ultrasound imaging at a low cost, without the need for expensive and non-modifiable specific equipment. The goal of this work resembles the needs of medical systems in the 80’s where analog techniques using single-sensor devices were prominent. To this end, two open-source, arduino-like modules have been developed for building a simple, yet complete, single-channel analog front-end system, where all the intermediary signals are readily accessible by the user. A single-channel architecture avoids the beamforming overhead, though it limits the quality of the captured image, and brings simplicity to the system. The modules were tested using re-purposed ultrasound mechanical probes, as well as non-medical transducers. Furthermore, different digital acquisition systems were utilized for providing the images of interest. The developed modules can also be used in Radio Frequency (RF) projects, non-destructive testing and control projects, as well as in low-cost medical imaging projects on non-living samples.},

To enable 3D TEE, a matrix piezoelectric ultrasound transducer with more than 2000 elements will be used. Since a gastroscopic tube cannot accommodate the cables needed to connect all the transducer elements directly to an imaging system, local channel-count reduction is necessary. The main task of the ASIC is to provide appropriate signal conditioning in the tip of the probe to achieve channel-count reduction. The main goal of this thesis work is to design such an ASIC using simple, low-power circuits, while still maintaining good image quality. In addition to the electronics design, the interconnection between the matrix transducer and the ASIC is another important parallel research topic.},

Video capsule endoscopy is currently commercially available worldwide. However, it is limited to visualization of superficial tissue. Ultrasound (US) imaging is a complementary solution as it is capable of acquiring transmural information from the tissue wall. This paper presents a mechanical scanning device incorporating a high-frequency transducer specifically as a proof of concept for US capsule endoscopy (USCE), providing information that may usefully assist future research. A rotary solenoid-coil-based motor was employed to rotate the US transducer with sectional electronic control. A set of gears was used to convert the sectional rotation to circular rotation. A single-element focused US transducer with 39-MHz center frequency was used for high-resolution US imaging, connected to an imaging platform for pulse generation and image processing. Key parameters of US imaging for USCE applications were evaluated. Wire phantom imaging and tissue phantom imaging have been conducted to evaluate the performance of the proposed method. A porcine small intestine specimen was also used for imaging evaluation in vitro. Test results demonstrate that the proposed device and rotation mechanism are able to offer good image resolution ( 60 μm) of the lumen wall, and they, therefore, offer a viable basis for the fabrication of a USCE device.},

	abstract = {There has been an emerging interest in high intensity focused ultrasound (HIFU) for therapeutic applications. By means of its thermal or mechanical effects, HIFU is able to serve as a direct tool for tissue ablation, or an indirect moderating medium to manipulate microbubbles or perform heating (hyperthermia) for the purpose of targeted drug delivery. The development and testing of HIFU based phased arrays is favorable as their elements allow for individual phasing to steer and focus the beam. While FDA has already approved tissue ablation by HIFU for the treatment of uterine fibroids (2004) and pain from bone metastases (2012), development continues on other possible applications that are less forgiving of incomplete treatment, such as thermal necrosis of malignant masses.Ideally, each element, of such an array must have its own fully programmable electrical driving channel, which allows the control of delay, phase, and amplitude of the output from each element. To enable full control, each channel needs a waveform generator, an amplification device, and an impedance matching circuit between driver and acoustic element.Similar projects utilizing this approach to drive therapeutic arrays include a 512-channel therapy system which was built at the University of Michigan using low cost Field-Programmable Gate Arrays (FPGA) microcontroller and highly efficient MOSFET switching amplifiers [1]. However, this system lacks the ability to drive both, continuous wave (CW) and transient short duty-cycle high power pulses.This paper presents a hybrid system, which is able to perform CW and transient short duty-cycle high power excitation. In the following we will describe the design, programming, fabrication, and evaluation of this radiofrequency (RF) driver system as used in our laboratory for a 1.5 MHz center frequency, 298-element array (Imasonic SA, Besancon, France) [2], FPGA-controlled amplifier boards and matching circuitry. Advantages of our design include: 1. Inexpensive components ({\textless}\$15/channel); 2. Ability to program/drive individual output channels independently; 3. Sufficient time and amplitude resolution for various acoustic pattern design; 4. Capability of hybrid switching between low power CW and short duty cycle, high instantaneous power.},

	abstract = {Three-dimensional ultrasound is a powerful imaging technique, but it requires thousands of sensors and complex hardware. Very recently, the discovery of compressive sensing has shown that the signal structure can be exploited to reduce the burden posed by traditional sensing requirements. In this spirit, we have designed a simple ultrasound imaging device that can perform three-dimensional imaging using just a single ultrasound sensor. Our device makes a compressed measurement of the spatial ultrasound field using a plastic aperture mask placed in front of the ultrasound sensor. The aperture mask ensures that every pixel in the image is uniquely identifiable in the compressed measurement. We demonstrate that this device can successfully image two structured objects placed in water. The need for just one sensor instead of thousands paves the way for cheaper, faster, simpler, and smaller sensing devices and possible new clinical applications.
Compressive 3D ultrasound imaging is possible with only one sensor and a simple aperture coding mask.
