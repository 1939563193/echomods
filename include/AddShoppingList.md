## Shopping list

Here's a couple of things we're working on, for which you could help as well.

* Boosting the 6Msps croaker acquisition (see Wayne?)
* gh-pages: adding presentations, files list, community
* Adding PPTs to the makedoc list
* Processing PPTs

* Choose the design once the modules are done (in [sleepy](/sleepy/))
* Get to work with Arthur (in [sleepy](/sleepy/))
* Remove the jitter (see image in Rdme) (in [cletus](/cletus/))
* Testing the limits of ADC acquisition (speed / bits) (in [tomtom](/tomtom/))
* Save images as DICOMs (in [tomtom](/tomtom/))
* Understand why some GPIOs do not have lower values at 0.. (in [tomtom](/tomtom/))
* MixedGadget =&gt; <a href="http://isticktoit.net/?p=1383">Storage + ethernet</a> or <a href="https://gist.github.com/gbaman/50b6cca61dd1c3f88f41">this</a> or <a href="https://learn.adafruit.com/turning-your-raspberry-pi-zero-into-a-usb-gadget/overview">that</a>. (in [tomtom](/tomtom/))
* Set pins to down <a href="https://raspberrypi.stackexchange.com/questions/4664/setting-gpio-value-on-boot">on boot</a> (in [tomtom](/tomtom/))
* Change the viewme (in [doj](/doj/))
* Adapt power supply from v2 - smaller board footprint (in [doj](/doj/))
* Add a level shifter been Pon 3.3 and 5 and Poff 3.3 and 5 (in [doj](/doj/))
* A bit more space around the Pi0/PiW headers (in [doj](/doj/))
* Proper silkscreening around the Pi0 headers (they are reversed) (in [doj](/doj/))
* Jumper for the ADC in.. and selector (enveloppe and amplified signal) (either to Feather or to ADC .. and dedicated pin on Rpi) (in [doj](/doj/))
* SPI from RPi to Oled... or SPI to screen (to be checked in both case) .. or both kept, there are two SPI (in [doj](/doj/))
* Find the code back (in [oneeye](/oneeye/))
* Replace the work done by <a href="/oneeye/">OneEye</a> by <a href="/croaker/">Croaker</a> - that is, pulse control. (in [croaker](/croaker/))
* Get better total ADC speed with an iterleaved move (in [croaker](/croaker/))
* Develop a Cletus+Croaker way of working with a gyroscope+accelerometer. (in [croaker](/croaker/))
* Have Croaker generate its own AP (in [croaker](/croaker/))
* Enhance the BBB to transform it into a ultrasound server (in [toadkiller](/toadkiller/))
* <em>BONUS!</em> Plug it to a <a href="/croaker/">RPi0 or BBB or RPi</a> or else. (in [goblin](/goblin/))
* Connect the ADC to a RPi0 (in [goblin](/goblin/))
* <em>BONUS!</em> benchmark power supplies  (in [mogaba](/mogaba/))
