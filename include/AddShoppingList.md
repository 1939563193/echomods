Here's a couple of things we're working on, for which you could help as well.

* Boosting the [6Msps croaker](/retired/croaker/) acquisition (see Wayne?) to the full 6Msps 

### Todos from Modules
* None (in [wirephantom](/wirephantom/))
* See the <a href="/matty/nextsteps.md">next steps</a> (in [matty](/matty/))
* Having it work with a <a href="/retroATL3/">retroATL3</a> (in [matty](/matty/))
* Test Goblin v2 (in [goblin](/goblin/))
* Review a bipolar design (originally alt.tbo -- but double the components and hence the price) (in [lite.tbo](/lite.tbo/))


### Todos from worklog
* add Visa, possibly Pouya and Thomas as contributors
* map interested (green) 
* Add a documentation server
* Display IP on the OLED.
* Need to have a look at this RPI GPIO DMA - https://github.com/hzeller/rpi-gpio-dma-demo
* Include some cletus remarks (sourcing) on gitbook

* _senjak_ 15:07 In Which a PDF is a Git Repository Containing its own Latex Source and a Copy of Itself -- https://github.com/ESultanik/PDFGitPolyglot/blob/master/make_polyglot.sh
* 20171111a and 20171112b Readmes
* impedance matching -- [see more](/include/impedance/ipm.pdf) -- Butterworth-Van-Dyke or [here](https://electronics.stackexchange.com/questions/245915/picking-source-resistance-for-impedance-matching). [Tuning Filter](https://i.stack.imgur.com/96XMb.png).
* list other initiatives
* classifier articles with link Article: =)
* a page sumarizing the experiments (as in the __Experiments__ page in the gitbook)
* Brainstorm for @senjak information design:
* un0rick site to have plenty of stuff
 * Publish first drafts on un0rick GH / GH-pages / gitbook
* create v2 release once gob.v2 and corrected/working alt.tbo v2 are ready.
* use [General Design Procedure for Free and Open-Source Hardware for Scientific Equipment](http://www.mdpi.com/2411-9660/2/1/2/htm) as a reference
* compare [old pulser](/retired/alt.tbo/20171111a/20171111-pulses.ipynb) (pulser) and [new acs](/matty/20180224b/20180221b-Client.ipynb) for matty readme
 * for matty [Rip this intro?](https://qspace.library.queensu.ca/bitstream/handle/1974/6235/Wall_Kieran_A_201012_PhD.pdf?sequence=1&isAllowed=y)
* clean all repos for a v2 release of modules 
 * decrypt the connector =)
 * Script to check IMGs URL matches path
 * reorganise
Loved Nasa: add to un0rick
* change path of images when they have changed
* Create detailed pages for the community in the gitbook
* Create detailed pages for each probe [I've played with](/include/probes/Readme.md) in the gitbook
* add dp location
* listing experiments of others
* before reclean full repo, create release "Full Dev Resources" and get corresponding version (v1.9 + hash)!
 * : Add Full GitBook PDF to it before
* Sort the list of experiments, shortnames in SUMMARY
* Community: list the contributors in a page + add the experiment. Individual page to point to experiment.
* Page on documentation
* Edit [history](https://kelu124.gitbooks.io/echomods/content/Chapter1/history.html) page to add Matty.
* Rewrite the Chapters Readme -> "This chapter is dedicated to the brain_dumps "
* Do a Doj (LOW PRIORITY)
* Redo a usable alt.tbo (LOW PRIORITY)
* Clean Modules list (keep lite.tbo, goblin, cletus, doj, elmo, matty) + add "CNprobe"
 * Make 7 clean QuickStarts for remaining modules // copy them on Tindie.
 * Get "ShortNames" in JSON
* Put alt.tbo, tobo, loftus, tomtom, croaker, retroATL3 and wirephantom in retired modules + add "PU3090" phantoms in retired
* Remove sets in doc
* Remake homepage in autodoc
* Clean obsolete versions in repos
* contact the [author](https://repository.tudelft.nl/islandora/object/uuid%3A8784cc2b-10a1-47e7-a87f-ce25062d456f) !
