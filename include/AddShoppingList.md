Here's a couple of things we're working on, for which you could help as well.

* Boosting the [6Msps croaker](/croaker/) acquisition (see Wayne?) to the full 6Msps 

### Todos from Modules
* None (in [wirephantom](/wirephantom/))
* Check a design w/ <a href="/alt.tbo/images/md1811_ref.jpg">this idea</a> which is similar to <a href="/alt.tbo/images/md1210_ref_2.jpg">this other idea</a> or <a href="/alt.tbo/images/md1210_ref.jpg">this last idea</a>. (in [alt.tbo](/alt.tbo/))
* Remove the jitter (see image in Rdme) (in [cletus](/cletus/))
* Include <a href="/cletus/2017-06-08_FindingSuppliers.md">notes</a> (in [cletus](/cletus/))
* Save images as DICOMs (in [tomtom](/tomtom/))
* See the <a href="/matty/nextsteps.md">next steps</a> (in [matty](/matty/))
* Having it work with a <a href="/retroATL3/">retroATL3</a> (in [matty](/matty/))
* Replace the work done by <a href="/retired/oneeye/">OneEye</a> by <a href="/croaker/">Croaker</a> - that is, pulse control. (in [croaker](/croaker/))
* Get better total ADC speed with an iterleaved move (in [croaker](/croaker/))
* Develop a Cletus+Croaker way of working with a gyroscope+accelerometer. (in [croaker](/croaker/))
* Have Croaker generate its own AP (in [croaker](/croaker/))
* Test Goblin v2 (in [goblin](/goblin/))
* TBD (in [loftus](/loftus/))


### Todos from worklog
* 6Msps on the [STM32](/croaker/)
* dig into [CMOS Ultrasound Transceiver Chip for High-Resolution Ultrasonic Imaging Systems.](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/23853268)
* add Visa, possibly Pouya and Thomas as contributors
* map interested (green) 
* Add a documentation server
* Display IP on the OLED.
* Need to have a look at this RPI GPIO DMA - https://github.com/hzeller/rpi-gpio-dma-demo
* Include some cletus remarks (sourcing) on gitbook
* convert all previous images to dicom
* set the gain on the AFE using Doj v1.2
* use the GetSuppliersList function to list equipment suppliers
* add some ideas for [the pulser](https://electronics.stackexchange.com/questions/212667/ultrasound-transducer-excitation-frequency-transistor-type?rq=1) to the alt.pulser board
* remove gitbook MD files from the log
* link to files in the log (python)
* Main readme as TPL
* DICOM rest of images
* test some compressed sensing using [golay codes](/include/20170325/PulseCode.pdf) on a single element piezo
* add some new articles to the new article
* _senjak_ 15:07 In Which a PDF is a Git Repository Containing its own Latex Source and a Copy of Itself -- https://github.com/ESultanik/PDFGitPolyglot/blob/master/make_polyglot.sh
* 20171111a and 20171112b Readmes
* impedance matching -- [see more](/include/impedance/ipm.pdf) -- Butterworth-Van-Dyke or [here](https://electronics.stackexchange.com/questions/245915/picking-source-resistance-for-impedance-matching). [Tuning Filter](https://i.stack.imgur.com/96XMb.png).
* list other initiatives
* classifier articles with link Article: =)
* better experiments scanning
* readding description into experiment files
* a page summarizing the experiments
* un0rick site to have plenty of stuff
 * Create matty module 
 * Publish first drafts on un0rick GH / GH-pages / gitbook
 * create un0rick page on echomods gitbook
