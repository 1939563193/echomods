Here's a couple of things we're working on, for which you could help as well.

* Boosting the [6Msps croaker](/croaker/) acquisition (see Wayne?) to the full 6Msps 

### Todos from Modules
* Remove the jitter (see image in Rdme) (in [cletus](/cletus/))
* Include <a href="/cletus/2017-06-08_FindingSuppliers.md">notes</a> (in [cletus](/cletus/))
* Testing the limits of ADC acquisition (speed / bits) (in [tomtom](/tomtom/))
* Save images as DICOMs (in [tomtom](/tomtom/))
* Understand why some GPIOs do not have lower values at 0.. (in [tomtom](/tomtom/))
* MixedGadget =&gt; <a href="http://isticktoit.net/?p=1383">Storage + ethernet</a> or <a href="https://gist.github.com/gbaman/50b6cca61dd1c3f88f41">this</a> or <a href="https://learn.adafruit.com/turning-your-raspberry-pi-zero-into-a-usb-gadget/overview">that</a>. (in [tomtom](/tomtom/))
* Set pins to down <a href="https://raspberrypi.stackexchange.com/questions/4664/setting-gpio-value-on-boot">on boot</a> (in [tomtom](/tomtom/))
* Change the viewme (in [doj](/doj/))
* Replace the work done by <a href="/oneeye/">OneEye</a> by <a href="/croaker/">Croaker</a> - that is, pulse control. (in [croaker](/croaker/))
* Get better total ADC speed with an iterleaved move (in [croaker](/croaker/))
* Develop a Cletus+Croaker way of working with a gyroscope+accelerometer. (in [croaker](/croaker/))
* Have Croaker generate its own AP (in [croaker](/croaker/))


### Todos from worklog
* 6Msps on the [STM32](/croaker/)
* Sourcing transducer
* dig into [CMOS Ultrasound Transceiver Chip for High-Resolution Ultrasonic Imaging Systems.](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/23853268)
* contact Sonopen / microsonix
* add Visa (possibly Pouya)
* map interested (green) and users (blue)
* Add a documentation server
* Display IP on the OLED.
* Need to have a look at this RPI GPIO DMA - https://github.com/hzeller/rpi-gpio-dma-demo
* Include some cletus remarks (sourcing) on gitbook
* convert all previous images to dicom
* answer some questions online for RPI + ultrasound
* put probe on the setup
* set the gain on the AFE using Doj v1.2
* use the GetSuppliersList function to list equipment suppliers
* get stats from hackaday 1,2,GHMurgen,GHechomods,JOH
* Add PCBA
 * fill in probe if necessary -> need oil in it
* update ppt_us with links all around
