Here's a couple of things we're working on, for which you could help as well.

* Boosting the [6Msps croaker](/croaker/) acquisition (see Wayne?) to the full 6Msps 

### Todos from Modules
* None (in [wirephantom](/wirephantom/))
* Check a design w/ <a href="/alt.tbo/images/md1811_ref.jpg">this idea</a> which is similar to <a href="/alt.tbo/images/md1210_ref_2.jpg">this other idea</a> or <a href="/alt.tbo/images/md1210_ref.jpg">this last idea</a>. (in [alt.tbo](/alt.tbo/))
* Remove the jitter (see image in Rdme) (in [cletus](/cletus/))
* Include <a href="/cletus/2017-06-08_FindingSuppliers.md">notes</a> (in [cletus](/cletus/))
* Save images as DICOMs (in [tomtom](/tomtom/))
* See the <a href="/matty/nextsteps.md">next steps</a> (in [matty](/matty/))
* Having it work with a <a href="/retroATL3/">retroATL3</a> (in [matty](/matty/))
* Replace the work done by <a href="/retired/oneeye/">OneEye</a> by <a href="/croaker/">Croaker</a> - that is, pulse control. (in [croaker](/croaker/))
* Get better total ADC speed with an iterleaved move (in [croaker](/croaker/))
* Develop a Cletus+Croaker way of working with a gyroscope+accelerometer. (in [croaker](/croaker/))
* Have Croaker generate its own AP (in [croaker](/croaker/))
* Test Goblin v2 (in [goblin](/goblin/))
* TBD (in [loftus](/loftus/))


### Todos from worklog
* add Visa, possibly Pouya and Thomas as contributors
* map interested (green) 
* Add a documentation server
* Display IP on the OLED.
* Need to have a look at this RPI GPIO DMA - https://github.com/hzeller/rpi-gpio-dma-demo
* Include some cletus remarks (sourcing) on gitbook
* add some ideas for [the pulser](https://electronics.stackexchange.com/questions/212667/ultrasound-transducer-excitation-frequency-transistor-type?rq=1) to the alt.pulser board
* remove gitbook MD files from the log
* link to files in the log (python)
* Main readme as TPL
* test some compressed sensing using [golay codes](/include/20170325/PulseCode.pdf) on a single element piezo
* _senjak_ 15:07 In Which a PDF is a Git Repository Containing its own Latex Source and a Copy of Itself -- https://github.com/ESultanik/PDFGitPolyglot/blob/master/make_polyglot.sh
* 20171111a and 20171112b Readmes
* impedance matching -- [see more](/include/impedance/ipm.pdf) -- Butterworth-Van-Dyke or [here](https://electronics.stackexchange.com/questions/245915/picking-source-resistance-for-impedance-matching). [Tuning Filter](https://i.stack.imgur.com/96XMb.png).
* list other initiatives
* classifier articles with link Article: =)
* a page sumarizing the experiments (as in the __Experiments__ page in the gitbook)
* Brainstorm for @senjak information design:
* un0rick site to have plenty of stuff
 * Publish first drafts on un0rick GH / GH-pages / gitbook
* create v2 release once gob.v2 and corrected/working alt.tbo v2 are ready.
* use [General Design Procedure for Free and Open-Source Hardware for Scientific Equipment](http://www.mdpi.com/2411-9660/2/1/2/htm) as a reference
* compare [old pulser](/alt.tbo/20171111a/20171111-pulses.ipynb) (pulser) and [new acs](/matty/20180224b/20180221b-Client.ipynb) for matty readme
 * for matty [Rip this intro?](https://qspace.library.queensu.ca/bitstream/handle/1974/6235/Wall_Kieran_A_201012_PhD.pdf?sequence=1&isAllowed=y)
* clean all repos for a v2 release of modules 
 * decrypt the connector =)
 * Script to check IMGs URL matches path
 * reorganise
Loved Nasa: add to un0rick
