## Why a CLA?

A CLA is a legal document in which you state you are entitled to contribute the code/documentation/translation to the project you’re contributing to and are willing to have it used in distributions and derivative works. This means that should there be any kind of legal issue in the future as to the origins and ownership of any particular piece of code, then that project has the necessary forms on file from the contributor(s) saying they were permitted to make this contribution.

## CLA is a safety (bis)

The CLA also ensures that once you have provided a contribution, you cannot try to withdraw permission for its use at a later date. People and companies can therefore use that software, confident that they will not be asked to stop using pieces of the code at a later date.

## PI

By default, if the contract does not define who will own the property, it is more likely than not that the person who wrote it will own it.

Two big families: the contributor:

* can assign the copyright in all contributions to the project owner; 
* can grant an irrevocable licence to allow the project maintainer to use the contribution. 

## Several cases

Different use-cases:
* paid: employees, contractors, ..
* unpaid: individual contributors
* unclear: partners, organizations, trainees, ...

## Canonical typical CLA

As of August 2011, Canonical is requesting contributions be licensed under a Harmony Contribution Licence Agreement, rather than the copyright being assigned to Canonical. With the Harmony CLA, _"the contributor gives Canonical a licence to use their contributions. The contributor continues to own the copyright in the contribution, with full rights to re-use, re-distribute, and continue modifying the contributed code, allowing them to also share that contribution with other projects."_

## Apache

All contributors of ideas, code, or documentation to any Apache projects _complete, sign, and submit (via fax or email) an Individual Contributor License Agreement (ICLA)_. __The purpose of this agreement is to clearly define the terms under which intellectual property has been contributed to the Project and thereby allow us to defend the project should there be a legal dispute regarding the software at some future time__. _A signed ICLA is required to be on file before an individual is given commit rights to a project_.

## Why not a CLA ?

CLAs twist the empowering, community-oriented, enjoyable experience of FLOSS contribution into an annoying exercise in pointless bureaucracy, which (if handled properly) requires a business-like, grating haggle between necessarily adverse parties.

## Simpler?

Most projects use the same time-honored and successful mechanism used throughout the 35 year history of the Free Software community:  submissions using the normal means to contribute to the project — such as patches to the mailing list or pull and merge requests — indicate the contributors' assent for inclusion of that Contribution in the canonical version under the project's license.


## What link with echOpen's license

__11. Patents.__
