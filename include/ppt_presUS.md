## Objective

The objective of this project is to propose an open-source, low-cost dev-kit ultrasound imaging  to allow scientists, academics, hackers, makers or OSHW fans to hack their way to ultrasound imaging.

## Bases of ultrasound imaging

## What tech approach ?

* Going back to the time when ultrasound was all mechanical.
* Having a modular "approach"
* Simplify !

## Signals

## Architecture

## Cost of the set: 325$

* A probe on ebay: 75$
* High voltage module: 80$ of components
* Analog processing module: 80$ of components
* PCBs: 40$
* ADC Pi Hat: 40$ 
* Pi: 10$

## Example of a probe image  {data-background="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/kelu124/echomods/master/include/20160814/sonde3V_1-4.csv-SC.png"}

## Proof of concept

## Limitation and opportunity

__Limits__

* Material is not certified
* Probe sensor limits the quality

__Opportunity__

* Using a smartphone
* An open plat-form!

## Lessons

* _Build the tools you need_ 
* _Document_
* _Do and share_


## Acquisition

Build the tools you need..

* BeagleBone DAQ
* BitScope
* STM32 (Feather WICED)
* ... __custom made__!

* Emulation & calibration tools

## Documentation

* Documentation here is key. 
* A website that builds itself based on proper, simple and un-redondant information is needed. 

## Doing and sharing

* Documentation on GitHub
* "Blogging" on Hackaday
* A summary on Journal of Open Hardware (thanks GOSH!)
* Tindie for sharing "extra" boards

## Pending issues

* Certification
* Sensors sourcing
* Moving forward !
 
## We can discuss how

* to do a working dev-kit
* implement and efficient (err, lazy) way of documenting. 
* share with a community
* better understand your "product"
