## Objective

The objective of this project is to propose an open-source, low-cost dev-kit ultrasound imaging __to allow scientists, academics, hackers, makers or open hardware fans to hack ultrasound imaging__.

## What approach ?

* Going back to the time when ultrasound was all mechanical.
* Having a modular "approach"
* Simplify !

## Bases of ultrasound imaging

## Signals

## Architecture

## Proof of concept

## Cost of the set: 325$

* A probe on ebay: 75$
* High voltage module: 80$ of components
* Analog processing module: 80$ of components
* PCBs: 40$
* ADC Pi Hat: 40$ 
* Pi: 10$

## Example of a probe image  {data-background="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/kelu124/echomods/master/include/20160814/sonde3V_1-4.csv-SC.png"}

## Limitation and opportunity

__Limits__

* Material is not certified
* Probe sensor limits the quality

__Opportunity__

* Using a smartphone
* An open plat-form!

## Lessons

What I learned tinkering with stuff

* _Build the tools you need_ 
* _Document_
* _Do and share_


## Build the tools you need..

Acquisition

* BeagleBone DAQ
* BitScope
* STM32 (Feather WICED)
* ... __custom made__!

* Emulation & calibration tools

## Documentation

* Documentation here is key. 
* A website that builds itself based on proper, simple and un-redondant information is needed. 

## Doing and sharing

* Documentation on [GitHub](https://github.com/kelu124/echomods/) and [GitBook](https://kelu124.gitbooks.io/echomods/content/)
* "Blogging" on [Hackaday](https://hackaday.io/project/9281-murgen-open-source-ultrasound-imaging)
* A summary on [Journal of Open Hardware](http://openhardware.metajnl.com/articles/10.5334/joh.2/) (thanks GOSH!)
* [Tindie](https://www.tindie.com/stores/kelu124/) for sharing "extra" boards

## Possible issues for medical biohacking

* Certification
* Sensors sourcing
* Reliability of the device
* Training of users
 
## We can discuss how

* to do a working dev-kit to share knowledge
* implement and efficient (err, lazy) way of documenting. 
* share with a community
* better understand your "product"
