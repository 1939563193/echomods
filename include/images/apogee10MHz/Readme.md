#  `apogee10MHz`

## Description

* Strange head. soft interface. Rubber-ish.
* IC in head (eeprom ?)
* pogo pins on several layers in the head
* Two coax: two piezos?
* 3x2 cables for a motor
  * black and orange together
  * white and red
  * green and blue	
* Position IC too
* 2 x coax to piezo (golden thread)

## Second round

* Exact.. two piezos, one that can be set with an angle (doppler ?) and the other on a motor.
* optical encoder for the position
