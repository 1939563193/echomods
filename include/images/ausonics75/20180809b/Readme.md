# Getting in a Ausonics 7.5MHz probe - `20180809b`

First view: seems to be an intracavity probe as usual.
* Connector, a bit big, hints at 4 coax, and 10 pins as usual.
* 4 channels of analog, 10 analog ?

A bit tricky to open, but back unscrews, then the plate gets removed.

Bit of cables in this small space, including a 5x2 header (what's that?), then 2 shielded coax, and 2 pairs.

There are 4 screws on the PCB, that we can safely remove. Not much on the PCB itself.
Coaxes go into a Tx1 and Tx2 points on the PCB, so I guess that's 2 piezos in the head.

The 5x2 really comes from the motor possibly for the stepper controls, then 2 pairs go to it as well (driving the motor?) and the 2 coax, still possibly for the piezos.

To test!
