# A kretz AW14/5B/A ultrasound probe - `20180809a`

Hum I have had this probe for a while, but the nice head does not want to be killed, so better be cautious.

I've been poking in the head as well, seeing 2 coax, 4 plugs, so I assume as usual that we have 1 motor, 1 piezo, and some counters on the head.

Back of the probe unscreaws, but I get stuck at opening it more, as I reach a white block that I can't move..
