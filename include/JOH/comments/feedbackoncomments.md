# First review

No, I do not recommend to phrase this in a more medial way. I fully agree with your reasons why. But it is probably a good idea to make it crystal clear to the reader that this is not intended nor suitable for medical use and a sentence with reference to these standards could be helpful to point the reader. Does this answer your question?

I already heard from the other reviewers (reviews coming soon), that they also wish for more diagrams and functional overview graphics of the hardware as part of the main paper. We will also try to indicate this better in the template in the future. This request goes for your final published hardware version- I don't feel in the position to judge on the inclusion of more complicated reference diagrams explaining 3rd party (medical hardware). Those certainly sound difficult to understand and perhaps a more functional reference or made-up top-level schematic could be helpful to put your project into context for readers. Even though your hardware is not medical, I imagine it is nevertheless a well-known context that readers would like to be able to put your hardware into. And applying your hardware for non-medical biology research will probably work in a similar way? Again, I feel that I am not expert enough to give you a good advice on it. You should decide what makes most sense to you and then let us know that decision explicitly when you re-submit.
