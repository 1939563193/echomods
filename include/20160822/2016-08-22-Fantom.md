# Acquiring a fantom image

The following acquisition was done with an [old mechanical ultrasound probe](/retroATL3/), along with the [pulser module](/tobo/), the [analog processing module](/goblin/). The acquisition was done with a [beaglebone PRUDAQ](/retired/kina/) at 10Msps. I'm not mentionning the [power supply module](/mogaba/).

You can download the raw data at [using this link](/include/20160822/20160822-205141.bin).

## Comparing with the fantom

I guess the points we see are the points on the left hand of the fantom. The top of the fantom is not seen as the near field artifact is at goes till around 2cm (according to the probe specs).

# Some comments

As seen in the list of probes, the probe we've been using has the following characteristics:

* near field artifact till 2cm
* focal point at 7cm
* Lateral resolution of 4.2mm at 7cm depth
* Axial resolution of 1.3mm at focal depth

This matches with what we're seeing.
