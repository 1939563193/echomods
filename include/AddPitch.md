# What is this project? [](@description Pitch/Intro of the project)

This project has a specific target of providing a __low-cost, open source technological kit to allow scientists, academics, hackers, makers or OSHW fans to hack their way to ultrasound imaging__ - below 500$ - at home, with no specific equipment required. For complementary sources of information, you can visit:

* the [github repo](https://github.com/kelu124/echomods/), for the source files, raw data and raw experiment logs;
* the [online manual/book](https://www.gitbook.com/book/kelu124/echomods/details) for a easily readable and searchable archive of the whole work;
* the [hackaday page](https://hackaday.io/project/9281-murgen-open-source-ultrasound-imaging), where I tried to blog day-to-day experiments in a casual format;
* an [article summarizing the experiment on the Journal of Open Hardware](http://openhardware.metajnl.com/articles/10.5334/joh.2/) - [DOI:10.5334/joh.2]( http://doi.org/10.5334/joh.2);
* the [slack channel if you want to discuss](https://join.slack.com/usdevkit/shared_invite/MTkxODU5MjU0NjI1LTE0OTY1ODgxMDEtMmYyZTliZDBlZA);
* the Tindie store for the [analog processing unit](https://www.tindie.com/products/kelu124/ultrasound-imaging-analog-processing-module/) and the [pulser](https://www.tindie.com/products/kelu124/ultrasound-imaging-pulser-module/) or [the motherboard](https://www.tindie.com/products/kelu124/ultrasound-modules-motherboard/).
 
__Disclaimer__: though an engineer, this project is the first of its sort, I never did something related. Bear with us, and the discovery process, but I'm happy to learn on the way =)

__Disclaimer #2__: ultrasound raises questions. In case you build a scanner, use caution and good sense!

__Disclaimer #3__: Beware! Though I am one of echopen's cofounders, this personnal pet-project lives in the echopen community, and is not a project in the scope of the echopen's association.
