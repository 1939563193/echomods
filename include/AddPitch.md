# What is this project?

This project has a specific target of providing a __low-cost, open source technological kit to allow scientists, academics, hackers, makers or OSHW fans to hack their way to ultrasound imaging__ - below 500$ - at home, with no specific equipment required.

__Disclaimer__: though an engineer, this project is the first of its sort, I never did something related. Bear with us, and the discovery process â€“ but I'm happy to learn on the way =)

__Disclaimer #2__: ultrasound raises questions. In case you build a scanner, use caution and good sense!

__Disclaimer #3__: Beware! It is a project which lives in the echopen community, not a project in the scope of echopen's association.
