## Experimenting with the [AD9200](/elmo/)

### Experiment

#### Setup

Along with an arduino to drive the servo -- see [arduino code](/elmo/data/arduino/arduino.ino)

#### The python notebook

See the [Jupyter Notebook](/elmo/data/arduino/20170611-arduino.ipynb)

#### Raspberry

* I changed back the [kernel module](/elmo/data/arduino/scope.c) to have proper pulser pins
* The _readout_ program to get the ADC values has [been changed too](/elmo/data/arduino/read.cpp).

### Results

### Lessons

* The Raspberry Pi seems to have some issues driving "cleanly" the servo. A proper driver to manage the servo (in this case an arduino) may be necessary.
* I had some issues in soldering the [2nd ADC "cleanly" too](/elmo/data/20170609-NewADC-v3.ipynb), two pins were soldered one with the other. 
* May need to rework the biais though.
* The interleaved mode works and values for the latch work. So I know the 2x10Msps is not impossible!
