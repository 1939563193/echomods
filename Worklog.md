# The EchoModules worklogs [](@description Full worklog of the modules)

## Next steps from [Murgen](http://github.com/kelu124/murgen-dev-kit/) 

1. Playing with the design and fab the modules: 3 to go in CMS (HV/TGC/MD, enveloppe detection, SPI ADC) and 2 in stripboard mode (alim, based on the breadboard 3.3V and 5V, as well as the controler, maybe an arduino nano at first) - and start the github repo / [echOmods](https://hackaday.io/project/10899-echomods) hackaday pages as well. Work on this with Sofian and Vlad. See also the [echOmods repo](https://github.com/kelu124/echomods/).
2. Playing with an electronic emulator of the transducer - as well as an electronic model. Work on this with a partner/supplier. [Actually produced in the end with a uC - Silent](/silent/).
3. Play with a ultrasound durable fantom. Work on this with **staticdet5** (commnotes_ent on HAD). Started a [project with Virginie and Static on HAD.io](https://hackaday.io/project/11478-open-source-ultrasound-phantoms).
4. Play with the BeagleBone PRUs. Work on this with Vanderbilt.
5. Playing with some intelligent uC of FPGA. uC has my preference at first for ease of use. WifiMCU seems fun (has a 8$ STM32F411CE - 100MHz, 2.4Msps ADC, FPU, DSP instructions and WiFi to stream!) or the [Feather Wiced](https://www.adafruit.com/product/3056) (arduino IDE compatible, based on a 34$ STM32F205 ARM Cortex M3 processor running at 120MHz. Project codename would be [Croaker](https://github.com/kelu124/echomods/croaker), not created yet. Who's volunteering?

## Brief

Mostly, the thing would be to separate the
[Murgen](http://github.com/kelu124/murgen-dev-kit/) PCB in 4 different
modules (similar to the arduino trinket pro for example), so to have
them ready to be used on a stripboard which would have already headers.

The strips would have the 19 tracks as on the attached picture below.

There would be 2 modules :

-   HV + pulser + md0100
-   TGC + enveloppe + SPI ADC

(Two other modules, Alim, and controler, will be stripboard based)

Given that the boards would be separated, would it make sense to try
to \*\*design the PCBs to have only 2 layers PCB\*\* ? The width of the
PCBs would not really matter, only to be sure they'd fit on a strip
board. It would be interesting to have a form factor of the modules PCB
comparable to one trinket pro =)

### Adjusting the specs for a research module

* 10ms between lines - 64 lines gives 640ms / image)
* 200us at 2Msps is 400 points is 5600 bits is 700 bytes
* 5600 bits per 10ms is 560,000 bits/s is 70kbytes/s.. should be OK with ESP8266 ;)

### Details about the modules

1\. HV+Pulser+MD0100 don't change. The module will need to have a SMA
connector (same as on existing board).

2\. VGA + enveloppe + ADC

* VGA+enveloppe detector can remain the same. I just need to remove the
filter that is between t	he TestPoints4 and 5 and the transformer. The
module output is the output of the ADL5511.
* SPI can be replaced, this one was an overkill. 10Msps is too much, so
instead a 2 or 3 Msps at 12 or 14 bits in SPI could be used on the ADC
module.

### Controls

The "controls" listed would be a potentiometer for the HV (as was done
for murgen), a potentiometer for the TGC Gain (not an ADC, bit of
overkill, rather a jumper to allow one to select the gain from either
the track or a potentiometer which would feed in from 0 to 1V).

### ADC details

The ADC can be as low as 12bits 2Msps when we're talking about envelope
detection (what about MAX11105?). (btw, the signal output by it is
offset by around 1.32V) on top of which we have 1.25V of signal. For the
sake of the experiment, I would add another ADC board, clone of the
11105, with a MAX11103, to comparatively test both.

### The motherboard

What is expected is to break down logic blocks into modules that could be put on a motherboard ( a 2.54mm stripboard), 19 tracks high.

## Description

Board 1, aka [Tobo](/tobo/Readme.md):

* The HV part of murgen is kept. The pulser of the first board is trigged by Pulse On (stripe 9) and shut by Pulse Off (stripe 10) (coming from the stripes). The pulser alimentation is fed through the RECOM component, with a potentiometer to select the HV level.
* Signal is sent to a sideway SMA connector. 
* Signal is protected by a MD0100 + LC.
* Low voltage signal is sent out of the board through a SMA connector.

Board 2, aka [Goblin](/goblin/Readme.md):

* Low amplitude signal comes from the SMA connector.
* It is fed through to the TGC.
* The Gain of the TGC can come either from the Analog Gain Ramp stripe (stripe 7) or from a potentiometer which gives it 0 to 1V - selection through a jumper.
* The filter part of the murgen board is removed (between TP2/3 and TP5/6)
* Raw signal is either send to stripe 3 or sent to the ADL5511, selection through a jumper.
* If output of the TGC goes to the ADL5511, it is then sent to the stripe 5 or to the 2/3Msps ADC (SPI).

Two other modules are being worked on, namely:

* controler
* alimentation

  * How to use it?

    *  For low-speed comms, conventional I2C or similar protocols can be used, and there is no need to use a PRU. For high-speed comms the PRU may be extremely useful because it can service the hardware with no interruptions due to Linux context switching, and no overhead is experienced by the main ARM processor. Here are some examples that should be feasible; basically quite a few possibilities, such as
   *  * interfacing to a fast ADC (e.g. analog capture)* * ,
  * https://theembeddedkitchen.net/beaglelogic-building-a-logic-analyzer-with-the-prus-part-1/449
 BBB is a 100MHz logic analyzer on a BeagleBoneBlack
  * Demo over the http://beaglelogic.github.io/webapp/
  * http://r.git.net/beagleboard/2013-10/msg00204.html
    *  Can the PRU be used to interface the Beaglebone to external ADC? I need to capture 500 micro-seconds of data at a 5 MHz rate.
    *  -&gt; * It depends on the interface to the ADC. There is a parallel capture interface that will easily run that fast, and you may be able to use the bit-shift interface to do serial or something like SPI if the PRU's capability lines up with what your ADC wants to see.* 
  * http://www.element14.com/community/community/designcenter/single-board-computers/next-gen_beaglebone//blog/2013/08/04/bbb--high-speed-data-acquisition-and-web-based-ui
    * In its current state, it grabs analog data from an ADC, and dumps it into memory on the BBB, ready to be displayed or further processed. It could be used for gathering analog information from sensors, CCDs or other data acquisition use-cases. To be reasonably useful, the desire was for it to support 20Mbytes/sec of data or more. It does achieve this, but it is for further study to find higher speed methods.* 
    * This is not such a bad idea, because in future the ADC could be swapped out to a (say) 10-bit ADC with no code change on the PRU.* 
    * Once the data has been captured (2000 samples in this example), the command byte is acknowledged, so that the Linux hosted application can know that the PRU has completed. The PRU now sits and waits for a new instruction from the Linux hosted application.* *  -&gt; works for us - fixed depth = fixed \# of samples
  * Buffer to be used : detailed at
 http://www.element14.com/community/community/designcenter/single-board-computers/next-gen_beaglebone//blog/2013/08/04/bbb--high-speed-data-acquisition-and-web-based-ui
    *  ''These were extremely important for two reasons. One reason is that the pins to the BBB that I wished to use need to be isolated during power-up, because they are used for selecting the boot method. If there was any unusual level on the pins upon power-up then the BBB will not boot from the eMMC. So, a tri-state buffer is needed. The other reason is that there is a fair bit of capacitance and it is highly likely that the ADC may not be able to directly drive the pins at high speed. I actually came across this problem while trying to connect a camera to the BBB. I struggled for days without realising that the camera could not support the load. So, the buffers are likely to be essential for most designs using the pins that were selected. I used a 74LVC244A device as a buffer. Note that the clock also needs a buffer, unless significant jitter is acceptable. No tri-state is required here, so I used a MC74VHC1GT50.

*  Orange Pi Plus 2 : A nasty little thing
*  BBB as always coming mostly from element14
 Some limits - not exploiting all ? http://exploringbeaglebone.com/chapter13/#The_ADS7883_Single-Channel_12-bit_ADC_1MSps_max
 SPI speed with BBB : http://fr.mathworks.com/help/supportpkg/beagleboneio/ug/use-the-beaglebone-black-spi-interface-to-connect-to-a-device.html (up to 32MHz) - which is
*  16 bits : is it possible to set all 16 pins on pru0 as inputs? I saw you mentioned something about disabling the microSD functionality on the BB to get access to all 16 pins, but I wasn't exactly sure how. -- heartofasquid
 I thought the PRUs had a 16bit parallel capture mode or are all the pins not available on the BBB? (need to consult the docs) section 4.5.2.2.3.2 of the tech ref spruh73c.pdf One thought I had was to use both PRUs to capture alternate bytes/words but that was just a thought, again are all the pins available?
 I'd made a mistake, it looks like all of PRU0's GPI pins may be available, if we are happy to lose the microSD (no big loss - there are other ways to get data in/out of the BBB). So, we can theoretically get high-res captures up to about 15bits, if we need 1 pin for the clock.

    Murgen, Tobo, Goblin, and Mira can merge - for a modular board -
    ideally as easy as possible to use!
* IDEA: capelec!
* Need also to push Goblin's files on the repo. Those are made with
    Eagle, not Altium, so a bit less options, but still interesting to
    see how to work with those files =)

#### 2016-02-25 Shorts

* Boards reached: issue with the 5V and GND - shortage

#### 2016-02-26 More about shorts

* Further tests. Shortage still exists.
  * Short is not on the PCB. Appears after solder.
* Found that the RECOM component was designed to be upside down --
    need to resolder it. Luckily it was a via component.
  * This would not be the source of the short anyhow.
  * EF recommends that we burn 10A on the 5V plane to see which
 component would burn.. hmm i'm quite shy to do this :p
* Documenting the issue on github.
* Sending back boards to EF.

#### 2016-02-28 Admin reports

Nice reading =)

* Basecamp outlines their goals -- which they say have always been the
    same -- on their website:
  * Have fun
  * Do exceptional work
  * Build the best product in the business
  * Experiment
  * Pay attention to the details
  * Treat people right
  * Tell the truth
  * Have a positive impact on the world around us
  * Give back
  * Keep learning.
* "Weâre also big believers in business 101. We donât spend more than
    we earn, we donât waste money on things that donât matter, we donât
    give away everything for free and hope weâll figure it out before we
    run out of cash. Weâre in business to stay in business, and we have
    15 profitable years in a row to back it up."

#### 2016-04-11 Microcontrollers choices

Choice of a uC: "le boulot des microcontrollers, ce qui me gene sur
l'espruino c'est le manque de sortie wifi - si on veut sortir des
donnees en wireless." Deux choix se profilent

* WICED : STM32F205RG 120MHz ARM Cortex M3 MCU : 17 timers et 3 Ã
    12-bit, 0.5 Î¼s ADCs with up to 24 channels and up to 6 MSPS in
    triple interleaved mode, 8- to 14-bit parallel camera interface (48
    Mbyte/s max.)
* Le WifiMCU : EMW3165 : M4: STM32F411CE @100MHz, DSP+FPU, 1Ã12-bit,
    2.4 MSPS A/D converter -- Ce qui me fait peur est un WifiMCU de base
    en LUA, a voir comment repasser sur du plus bas niveau. L'avantage
    par contre c'est qu'il est dispo chez hackspark, et coute 18â¬ au
    lieu des 35\$ du WICED =)

Remarques : Avec le M3 tu perds les instructions DSP et un FPU optionnel
(cf https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/ARM_Cortex-M). Par contre je ne sais
pas si c'est correctement exploite, ni si on en a vraiment besoin.

Il y a aussi le Module Particle "Photon"
http://www.lextronic.fr/P37394-module-particle-photon.html (M3 120 MHz
et wifi) ou l'Arietta
http://www.lextronic.fr/P32050-module-microcontrole-arietta-g25.html

#### 2016-04-18 ADL5511

* Playing a bit with ADL5511 : there's an EREF 
* We use offset remover (suiveur + gain de 2.5), and second op will do amplification, cause envelope output swing is saturated at 1.2-1.3V, We can use 2..2,5 gain to deliver nice and neat 2,6 ..3V input swing for ADC. 

#### 2016-04-20 Modules

##### Previous Generation

#### 2016-07-01 Meeting with Nicolas

* Terribly instructive. Lots to learn.

#### 2016-07-02 Strategy

* Just doing it!
* Key learning: will be having fun soon =)


#### 2016-07-03 Playing with a trifrequency probe

* Won the probe http://www.ebay.com/itm/Philips-ATL-Access-A-3Mhz-Ultrasound-Scanhead-Transducer-Probe-/262496926313?hash=item3d1e093a69:g:psAAAOSwcL5XMe0n (50$) -- that's a purely 3MHz probe, should be OK and we won't get too many issues with too high frequencies
* Played with the ATL10PV at [https://github.com/kelu124/murgen-dev-kit/blob/master/worklog/Session_9_ATL.md](https://github.com/kelu124/murgen-dev-kit/blob/master/worklog/Session_9_ATL.md). Not good results, high frequency elements are buggy.
* Any impact of the polarity of the pulse?? 
* TODO: Compare the polarity by switching polarity.

#### 2016-07-06 Making progress with EMW3165

* With the help of Igor, preparing a UDP server of EMW3165 and getting a throughput of 9Mbit/s on average.
* Getting one of the modules
* Requesting Nicolas' help on getting HV7360LA (fab's suppliers are lost)
* Thinking of the overall structure of the maker kit. I need a wooden box and an aquarium (plexiglass, glue = solvent cement)

#### 2016-07-15 Playing at the lab

1. Cleaning a signal with [Goblin](/goblin/) : done. The second log, with this time a new energy supply, gives a really beautiful outcome. Lesson: don't put 18V in a 3.3 and 5V regulator =) [See the results here](https://github.com/kelu124/echomods/blob/master/goblin/2016-07-15.md).

2. Playign with an ATL Access 3. Getting nice echoes... of 1.3V, even not using the full gain (60%) and the full pulser voltage on [Murgen](https://github.com/kelu124/murgen-dev-kit). [See the logs here](https://github.com/kelu124/echomods/tree/master/retired/retroATL3). Was some work with the oil refill =)

#### 2016-07-27 Apres Avignon

Yeayyy! [Beagleboard fondation tweeted about Murgen](https://twitter.com/beagleboardorg/status/757815778447986688) -- that's driving traffic to github =) 

High speed acquisition
* PRUDAQ

Slow Acquisition
* tobo/goblin+cletus+BBB to drive the goblin ADC
* tobo/goblin+cletus+hannin to wirelessly stream

I decided the emulation was going to be necessary to avoid playing all the time with piezos. It appears Teensy 3.2 can handle that.

Choice of the servo:

More stuff about Phantoms: http://meritus.kopernika.pl/homemade-tastes-better/

And ... working on the [2016 Summer presentation](https://github.com/kelu124/echomods/blob/master/include/20160720-Milestone.md). 


#### 2016-08-02 Last week, after a week holiday

* Working on the [milestone presentation](http://kelu124.github.io/echomods/20160720-Milestone.html).
* Received a 12V alim, the PRUDAQ, and pushed the issue with Silent onto github. Ongoing !


#### 2016-08-04 Soon off

* Working on the [finance file](https://github.com/kelu124/echomods/blob/master/include/Finance.md) --> still work to do !
* Setting the stuff on for 1000$ from HAD
* HD should have received the pulser module.. waiting for it =)
* Worked on the [doc-test script](https://github.com/kelu124/echomods/blob/master/doc/) to automatize the results of modules documentation tests -- [see an example with an error](https://github.com/kelu124/echomods/blob/master/example_fail.md)



#### 2016-08-08 First day

* Received tobo !! yeayyy
* Playing with Doj and assembling the board (tobo, goblin, oneeye and mogaba). Should be enough to get first images.
* power seems OK, first pulses look nice
* Todo: test with my transducer for Cletus, and with ATL3
* Thanks to Virginie for her support on debugging Doj !!

#### 2016-08-09 Moving forward

Roughly, all the modules are fine. Emulator is done and tested. Some tests today:

* Test Analog Processing + ATL3
    * -> https://github.com/kelu124/echomods/blob/master/goblin/2016-08-09.md
* Test Emulateur de signal + Analog processing
    * -> https://github.com/kelu124/echomods/blob/master/silent/Readme.md

What the next steps are :

__High priority:__

* Use PRUDAQ
    * Clip the signal between 0 and 2V
* Get image from the [retroATL3](/retroATL3)

__Medium Priority:__

* Bitbang Goblin's SPI directly
* Resume documentation

__Low Priority:__

* EMW3165 to move forward
* Cletus for Servo + Piezo (and mech parts) - using SmartMaterials piezos

#### 2016-08-10 Simple things

* Clipped the signal
* Documentation ongoing
* Received TFT+Servos

#### 2016-08-11 Small FPGA

Awesome work: a FPGA on a RPi0 footprint
* https://hackaday.io/project/13048-fleafpga-ohm-development-board

#### 2016-08-14 Acquiring a first image

* Read some [on this page](/include/20160814/2016-08-14-HackingAUltrasoundProbe.md): got an image from a ATL3 probe, a small metal cube in water.
* Leaving for holidays =)

#### 2016-08-22 Back from holidays
	
* Working with Virginie and Benoit to get images
* Got to play with a [general multi tissue fantom](/include/20160822/2016-08-22-Fantom.md): got an image from a ATL3 probe, of the fantom.
* What about [using Kaggle as a data repo](http://blog.kaggle.com/2016/08/17/making-kaggle-the-home-of-open-data/) for open data ?

#### 2016-08-24 Finalizing the autodocumentation to gitbook
	
* Yeay!! Done. [Gitbook available on this page](https://kelu124.gitbooks.io/echomods/content/)

#### 2016-08-26 Show and tell

* Showing the documentation generation process on an apero at l'Hotel Dieu

#### 2016-08-28 Sharp eye

* Thanks to a question raised by a sharp-eye, I'm putting as a disclaimer that this project is not one supported by the echopen's association. Even if I'm a cofounder of echopen, this project is a personnal one, for the echopen community. Clarified with hackaday, not an issue for them wrt the prizes.

#### 2016-08-29 Hey from Liberia

* got contacted for a partnership to improve, build, and crowdsell a set of modules. Interesting!

#### 2016-08-30 Some good news

* Got some feedback of PRUDAQ's people on the doc, thanks to them for this contribution!
* Zach's been back. Let's see what can be done.
* Prof Charles is going to be in Paris: let's meet!
* Been invited to speak at Hackaday's show for its prize on Nov 5th
* Trying to get the latest HV7360 from MC.. seems difficult to say the least

#### 2016-08-31 Habitat numerique

* Thinking about the use of the _"Logiciel and Objets libres, animer une communaute autour d'un projet ouvert"_
* Interesting : [STBone - BeagleBone form-factor STM32F427 board](http://ebrombaugh.studionebula.com/embedded/stbone/index.html)
* Doing some thinking about [the servo part](/cletus/) -- should be integrating a feather + screen to help debug the output =)

#### 2016-09-01 A ping from GroupGets

* Itâs not a surprise that our backers waste no time getting inventive. We were pleasantly surprised by a tweet to check out this novel application of PRUDAQ in a [DIY Ultrasound Imaging Platform](https://www.gitbook.com/read/book/kelu124/echomods). [_source_](http://us10.campaign-archive1.com/?u=0b4a06d3b16c2573ff89aa414&id=3c93652604&e=b8636f98a5).
* Need to find a way to clarify a CLA if forking this repo to somewhere else

    * http://codeandlife.com/2015/03/25/raspberry-pi-2-vs-1-gpio-benchmark/
    * Using the same experimental setup, the Raspberry Pi 2 is about 2 to three times faster. The fastest is still the C native library, topping out at just under 42 MHz. 
* Thinking of 20E-214 and moving to Alibaba for wireless probes. Will F.'s support reach?
* Using Vitamins for the gyro's probe. What name still for it? Longinus?

#### 2016-12-29 Moving forward

* Getting to think of the 20E-214 ones =)
* Chat with 1Tech, and the guy Patrice. Motivating.
* Trying to get some stuff from the arduino, namely to get it work as a server. [Far from being finished, on it](/croaker/feather_tests/2Msps_Server.ino).

#### 2017-01-02 Merry new year

* 20E214
    * Getting a propal from PR

#### 2017-01-10 Consolidating

_âWe do not grow absolutely, chronologically. We grow sometimes in one dimension, and not in another; unevenly. We grow partially. We are relative. We are mature in one realm, childish in another. The past, present, and future mingle and pull us backward, forward, or fix us in the present. We are made up of layers, cells, constellations.â_

* Presentation to [ESPGG](https://twitter.com/ESPGG/status/819967641607606272), participated to.
* Hardware: 
    * went to solder some stuff at HD

#### 2017-02-19 Update to Doj and such

* Thinking about an update for a neat, silkcreened, well designed motherboard. Would be excellent for Altay, Felix and maybe 
* Been doing some progress about the HV - working with Lorena to get one on board. I'll have 2 pulsers, will ask for 3. In total I'll still be able to send to (Afreen/Felix/Altay) + one for the GroupGet friends. Would leave me with one. 
* Afreen still working on the feather, after contacting the PRUDAQ guys.
* Get Felix on Slack?
* Call scheduled with Fouad on tuesday
* Making progress on 20e214 - control of the probe OK. Display remaining, then CSV saving.
* Taking more time about the Slack bot: lower priority
* Update by Tobey: he found a way to compare PDFs.


#### 2017-03-01 RPi0

See [this log](/goblin/pi0/HighSpeedBurstADC.md)

#### 2017-03-02 RPi0  bis

Given RPi0 capabilities in terms of [GPIOs](/croaker/notes_RPi0.md) - why not push it to 20Msps, 8 bits, for the cape?


#### 2017-03-05 Grmbl netty

Netty isn't nice... but just got my article accepted by JOH !

#### 2017-03-06 Further work

* Updated the [suppliers repo](/cletus/suppliers/Readme.md)
* Testing the [goblin](/goblin/) In/out transfer function on the [emulator](/silent/) signal: [read here](/retired/toadkiller/data/test_enveloppe/). The more I play with Jupyter notebooks, the more I like it.

* Thinking about the 15 - 20 - 25 Msps pHAT.

#### 2017-03-19 Finish Doj

* Working on [Doj](/doj) and releasing the KiCad definitive code - available on [OSHPark](https://oshpark.com/shared_projects/2taE6p4M).
* PCB of the [RPi0 high-speed ADC](https://github.com/kelu124/bomanz) is ongoing !
* Getting the last touches to the JOH article.

#### 2017-03-20 Doj ... unfinished

* Indeed. Forgot to add a ADC input directly from a strip, two strips for PulseOn and PulseOff, and a way to control the servo from the Pi.
* Also starting the new season of the HackadayPrize =) 
* Still some issues with [bomanz (on HAD)](https://hackaday.io/project/20455-20msps-adc-raspberrypi-extension-bomanz) PCB. Some pads suck. I guess I'll order the board from OSHPark along with [Doj's](/doj/) and solder all these tiny stuff. Not so many actually.

#### 2017-03-21 Moving forward

* Posted the Chinese probe project on Hackaday. Will play with the probe using a RPi framework. Should do the trick =)
* Following up on [6Msps upgrade](/croaker/), [mother board seem OK, silkscreen to do](/doj/), then [Pi1](https://github.com/kelu124/bomanz) and _Pi2_ to follow.
* [History](/include/AddHistory.md) to develop.

* boards are on their ways..
* so it's quiet !

#### 2017-04-04 Chinese probe SDK

* Moving forward! Capturing some images [from the probe, trying videos](https://github.com/kelu124/kina/blob/master/20170404-Crunching_Video)


#### 2017-04-06 Purple

* Got some PCBs for Bomanz, for both [high speed](https://github.com/kelu124/bomanz/blob/master/images/20170406_124950.jpg) and [CA3306E](https://github.com/kelu124/bomanz/blob/master/images/20170406_124914.jpg) ADCs.
* Got some PCB for [Doj, and tested those](/doj/20170406-PCBs.md)!

#### 2017-04-12 Mounted boards!

* Playing with DICOMs on Kina, should be ported to all images. [Example of code](https://github.com/kelu124/kina/blob/master/20170411-DICOM.ipynb) yields [funny dicoms](http://www.dicomlibrary.com/meddream/?study=1.2.826.0.1.3680043.8.1055.1.20170411215409237.878569250.8160869).
* [Here's what the ADCs boards look like](https://github.com/kelu124/bomanz/blob/master/images/20170406_124950.jpg).

#### 2017-04-13 Error, that's hot

* Tantalum capacitor: not in reverse! Never!! What are the odds that I put all 3 capacitors on 2 different boards _all in reverse_ ?

#### 2017-04-15 Capacitors connected

* That's well and done. Shall be trying this week end!
* Got 50$ bonus from OSHPark... yeay!!
* Tweet proposed by _"Cool, well if you want to release it as a product or anything then let us know and we'd be happy to help :-)"_ @PiSupply


#### 2017-04-17 End of week end

    * Using a 3 to 8 CMUT with a multiplexer =)
    * Adding a pulse control from the kernel module / driver for bomanz

#### 2017-05-15 Interleaved on RPi.

* Still about the [RPi0 high-speed ADC](https://github.com/kelu124/bomanz/) : if I can't get above 10Msps due to a memory copy time, I may be able to double the speed by having 2 ADCs interleaved... it's to test!
* Some answers for the CMUT stuff.. let's see if it's going somewhere !
* ATL probes connectors are LEMO 18 or 19 pin.

#### 2017-05-16 More todos.

* Discussing with groupgets
* Some guys forking the [Kina](https://github.com/kelu124/kina/) repo =)


#### 2017-05-19 Bomanz interleaved

* PCBs sent for a [High Speed ADC pHAT v3](https://github.com/kelu124/bomanz/tree/master/AD9200). This time, two interleaved AD9200s.

#### 2017-05-20 Working on ATL3

* [Managed to get a peak into a ATL probe](/retroATL3/2017-05-20_APeakInside.md) - update to the [ATL probe](/retroATL3/).
* Working on the offset

#### 2017-05-22 Testing Doj v2

* Got the PCBs and [tested them](/doj/20170522-DojV2tests.md). Yeayyy, they work! Slight hiccup with the ADC, nothing dramatic though =) Actually, two pins have a double use along with the ADC pins. Dumb me :p

#### 2017-05-29 Testing Doj v2

* Pushing some pics of the [devkit 2.0](/include/devkit2.0/20170529_203924_notes.jpg) - note that this config allows pulse transmit. Pulse from the pulser, receiving through the analog front end.. and acquisition managed by the adc and raspberry.
* Note to self: this config requires a "good" usb power supply. It succeded with a 5V 750mA power supply - but failed from USB.
* @todo Add a documentation server
* @todo Display IP on the OLED.

#### 2017-06-09 Lots ongoing !

* Got the boards for Bomanz v3 and SMD stuff

* @done Test YAML data on Markdown files (see contributors)

#### 2017-06-11 Testing the ADC

* Butchered the ADCs.. but I think I got the interleaved thing !
* Adding officially the ADC pHAT to the modules as [elmo](/elmo/) =)
* A summary of the [Pi HAT test with the modules to image](/elmo/data/arduino/20170611-arduino.md) and the [notebook](/elmo/data/arduino/20170611-arduino.ipynb).

#### 2017-07-28 Thinking of an end

Got some [amazing responses to the post on HN](https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=14869138), held the 1st pos for an hour +, got over 200 ups, that's quite enough =) I guess I'm coming close to an end on this project, and my target would be to try and have a presentable project before Year 2.  The five key milestones:

1. __Outreach__: I have sold 10 kits so far, have ordered 5 sets more to a CN PCBA. Will sell those - and let people choose what they want when they'll want to play with those. I guess I'll have the community Milestone reached when someone provide a significant improvement / publishes thanks to this kit. _Status: 50%_. Bonus point if a unreached continent so far is involved.
2. __Money__: thanks to the small margin on kits, and hackaday prizes, i'm quite [cash neutral](/include/Finance.md) as of today. Having the 5 kits sold would permit financing the acquisition of the unmantled CN probe. _Status: 100%_ Bonus:  trade the chinese probe on leboncoin / ebay.  _Status: 0%_
3. __Product__: I wanted to have a __ultrasound hat__ done. I now have this ADC pHAT done, which can be perfected, but it's quite a win, so a simple 80V monopolar ultrasound board (independant from the motor / multiplexer) could be reached by Nov. _Status: 0%_ Update: could be good to use the [probe head](/loftus/) to do a full portable probe =)
4. __Documentation__: There are a couple of notes here, I'd love to see all of those gathered / processed / put into a braindump. Gitbook is good enough, but lack structure for raw knowledge dump. TODOS include:
  * Listing all docs under YYYYMMDD
  * 
5. __Future__ I'd be keen on having a 8 to 16 elements module prepared, just so to prepare the next gen and passing over of the project. Jan and Ivan to support. _Status: 0%_ Muxing using ATTINY85 ?

Nice to have:
 
* A slack bot? It would be fun to have a supporting bot to answer queries, like "where are the elements benchmarked, how do you process dicom, ..."

#### 2017-08-05 Moving forward towards the board

* Added something about [the S3 probe](/loftus/source/s3/) 

* @done Adding the descs for modules and power needs
* @done Removing double Autogen tags
* @todo Main readme as TPL
* @todo DICOM rest of images

* @todo test some compressed sensing using [golay codes](/include/20170325/PulseCode.pdf) on a single element piezo

#### 2017-08-14 Zach

* Zach's work has [been published](https://www.youngscientistjournal.org/article/development-of-a-portable-and-inexpensive-ultrasound-imaging-device-for-use-in-the-developing-world) on https://www.youngscientistjournal.org/article/development-of-a-portable-and-inexpensive-ultrasound-imaging-device-for-use-in-the-developing-world =)
* Got the probe -- need to open it and explore it =) (or [here](/include/community/Zach/ZTaylor.pdf) in local).

#### 2017-08-17 Some RPi code

Working to get a transducer schema?

* http://www.brl.uiuc.edu/Downloads/bigelow/APPENDIX%20C.PDF
* http://www.biosono.com/PrmtLgd/PrmtLgd.php?id=TrnsRlc
* Add http://datasheet.octopart.com/MD1210DB1-Supertex-datasheet-164548.pdf in bench - theres a RC circuit to simulate a transducer

* Check python scripts from Mark

### Croaker

#### Case of Feather WICED
 
* 12 bits ADC
* 150 us acquisition, single channel
* 6 Msps interleaved mode

In 150 us (one line) you will get 6x12x150 = 10800 bits of data. On Wi-Fi speed 54Mb/s it will take 10800/54000000=0.0002s (200us) to send these data.

In practice, we rather see 8Mbit/s, thats 1.2ms to send it. 

#### Case of ESP8266

Lower specs (for dev kit - 1 to 2 image / s OK)

* SPI is 40MHz
* 14 bit
* 2 Msps
* Comm through SPI
* 10ms between lines - 64 lines gives 640ms / image)
* 200us at 2Msps is 400 points is 5600 bits is 700 bytes
* 5600 bits per 10ms is 560,000 bits/s is 70kbytes/s.. should be OK with ESP8266/EMW3165/equivalent ;)
