-   Received tobo !! yeayyy
-   Playing with Doj and assembling the board (tobo, goblin, oneeye and
    mogaba). Should be enough to get first images.
-   power seems OK, first pulses look nice
-   Todo: test with my transducer for Cletus, and with ATL3
-   Thanks to Virginie for her support on debugging Doj !!
