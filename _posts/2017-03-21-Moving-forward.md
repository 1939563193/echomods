-   Posted the Chinese probe project on Hackaday. Will play with the
    probe using a RPi framework. Should do the trick =)
-   Following up on [6Msps upgrade](/croaker/), [mother board seem OK,
    silkscreen to do](/doj/), then
    [Pi1](https://github.com/kelu124/bomanz) and *Pi2* to follow.
-   [History](/include/AddHistory.md) to develop.
