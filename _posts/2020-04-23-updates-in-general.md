-   worked on comparing both boards:
    https://github.com/kelu124/echomods/blob/master/include/experiments/auto/20200421a.md
    -- need a full fledge mini before moving forward with the
    comparison.
-   [verilog alaw
    compression](https://github.com/kelu124/vit3rick/tree/master/MSB_1_Enveloppe)
    is ok and [simuls on icarus
    OK](https://github.com/kelu124/vit3rick/tree/master/MSB_2_alaw/code_alaw/sim/icarus)
    too.
