-   Reflexions on documentation coming from this presentation on OSH
-   5Msps - Parallel - PRU up to 12 bits - can go further than
    5Msps (SOA)
-   Buffer has to come (no, not the buffer app - real world buffer)
-   Thinking as well on architecture \* Motor + transducer + top in the
    probe \* Board + BBB (Node.js still..) \* Output (if necessary)
