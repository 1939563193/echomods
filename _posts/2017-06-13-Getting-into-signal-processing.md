-   Managed to get the offset by inserting a 100pF capa in series with
    input
-   Testing the ADC now with the Offset, see
    [notebook](/elmo/data/arduinoffset/20170612-ArduinoFFTed.ipynb)
-   [RPi Article](/include/RPiHSDK.md) to be started
-   http://gnusha.org/\~gnusha/logs/html/2016-06-06.log.html as reminder
    of former tests
