1.  Cleaning a signal with [Goblin](/goblin/) : done. The second log,
    with this time a new energy supply, gives a really beautiful
    outcome. Lesson: don't put 18V in a 3.3 and 5V regulator =) [See the
    results
    here](https://github.com/kelu124/echomods/blob/master/goblin/2016-07-15.md).

2.  Playign with an ATL Access 3. Getting nice echoes... of 1.3V, even
    not using the full gain (60%) and the full pulser voltage on
    [Murgen](https://github.com/kelu124/murgen-dev-kit). [See the logs
    here](https://github.com/kelu124/echomods/tree/master/retired/retroATL3).
    Was some work with the oil refill =)
