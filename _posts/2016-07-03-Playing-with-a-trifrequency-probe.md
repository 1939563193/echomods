-   Won the probe

    -- that's a purely 3MHz probe, should be OK and we won't get too
    many issues with too high frequencies
-   Played with the ATL10PV at
    <https://github.com/kelu124/murgen-dev-kit/blob/master/worklog/Session_9_ATL.md>.
    Not good results, high frequency elements are buggy.
-   Any impact of the polarity of the pulse??
-   TODO: Compare the polarity by switching polarity.
