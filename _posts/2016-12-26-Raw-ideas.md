-   Max RPi speed : http://d-fence.sytes.net/raspberry-pis-gpio-speed/
    @todo --&gt; do it with the Rpi0
    -   http://codeandlife.com/2015/03/25/raspberry-pi-2-vs-1-gpio-benchmark/
    -   Using the same experimental setup, the Raspberry Pi 2 is about 2
        to three times faster. The fastest is still the C native
        library, topping out at just under 42 MHz.
-   Thinking of 20E-214 and moving to Alibaba for wireless probes. Will
    F.'s support reach?
-   Using Vitamins for the gyro's probe. What name still for it?
    Longinus?
