Nothing works yet on the MOSI line... strange to read those. Version
from 11/02 works still. To be explored!

-   On the good side, I had time to test the new Elmo v2 and Alt.tbo v2
    boards:
-   [Comparing new and old pulsers](/include/20180216a/Readme.md)
-   [With a new driver for the pulser and
    ADC](/include/20180217a/Readme.md)
