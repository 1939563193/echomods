title: 2018-03-16 Bard probe 1

---


-   Worked on a [bard probe with matty](/include/bard/inside.md)
-   [An interesting patent is here](/include/bard/US4399703.pdf) --
    found working on the [patent parsin' graph
    tool](https://github.com/kelu124/ultrasound-patents)
-   The more I glance at it, the more fascinated I become...
-   There is no motor! Just electromagnets =)
    -   Then no need for a stepper motor
    -   it may be the case that
-   The signal coming back is an already processed signal!
    -   It means the pulse should come from another part of the board...
        ie another pair of cables.
    -   Black and white? -&gt; 5 ohm between this pair.. why not?
    -   What about the other logics?
-   Next steps: trying and get the reference manual
-   Get full echographs boxes on ebay =)
