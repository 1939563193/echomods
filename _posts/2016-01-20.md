-   What about having a µC ( PIC24FJ128GC010 ?) right after the analog
    part - could be an additional board/cape stacked below (so with
    microcontrolleur and alimentation)
-   it would stream data like a wifi camera
-   receives the ping from the motor controleur
-   should we be ordering SMD stuff (flux, fer à souder, soufflerie?) -
    seems an idea
-   Creation des modules !
