-   Some great discussion on use of doppler for heart issues, [notes
    being here](/include/20170325/). Interesting DIY vintage doppler to
    do!
-   Put all the information on [the
    Trove](https://gitlab.com/kelu124/theTrove) temporarly before
    uploading to the main repo.
-   Updated the [Doj](/doj/),
    [Bomanz](https://github.com/kelu124/bomanz), and [the
    CA3306E](https://github.com/kelu124/bomanz/tree/master/CA3306E) board.
    Ordered as well on OSHPark, finally!
