-   Call for clarification
-   Open toolchain is Verilog / VHDL / Lattice tools
-   130 lines of 150us at 24Msps on 16 bits is 7488000 bits

-   Worked on two experiments: [pulser
    tests](/alt.tobo/20171111a/Readme.md) and [testing new
    probe](/alt.tobo/20171112a/Readme.md), [and again, once the probe is
    refilled](/alt.tobo/20171112b/Readme.md)

-   @todo 20171111a and 20171112b Readmes
