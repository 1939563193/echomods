-   Boards:
-   Confirmation that Seeedstudio does not ship out of north america
-   Getting other options and quotes from Advanced Circuits, Macrofab
    (awesome interface), PCB Pool.
-   Need for a filter to get be sure , there's a low frequency component
    that remains: to remove- and to center around 0V ?

Let's cut it to 500kHz ?

-   For headers, we have
-   12 input pins on P8 for PRU1 and 1 input pin for PRU1 on P9, these
    have been assigned for 12bitADC+Clock and the rest,
-   SPI for DAC,
-   Buffer enable and motor control have been assigned to PRU0.
-   For the controls in prototyping:
-   SW1 controls the gain range for TGC
-   SW2 controls the input range of the ADC,
-   Updating the blog as well, integration of disqus
