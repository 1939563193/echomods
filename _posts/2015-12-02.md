    -   For low-speed comms, conventional I2C or similar protocols can
        be used, and there is no need to use a PRU. For high-speed comms
        the PRU may be extremely useful because it can service the
        hardware with no interruptions due to Linux context switching,
        and no overhead is experienced by the main ARM processor. Here
        are some examples that should be feasible; basically quite a few
        possibilities, such as
-   -   interfacing to a fast ADC (e.g. analog capture)\* \* ,

    -   Can the PRU be used to interface the Beaglebone to external ADC?
        I need to capture 500 micro-seconds of data at a 5 MHz rate.
    -   -&gt; \* It depends on the interface to the ADC. There is a
        parallel capture interface that will easily run that fast, and
        you may be able to use the bit-shift interface to do serial or
        something like SPI if the PRU's capability lines up with what
        your ADC wants to see.\*

    -   In its current state, it grabs analog data from an ADC, and
        dumps it into memory on the BBB, ready to be displayed or
        further processed. It could be used for gathering analog
        information from sensors, CCDs or other data
        acquisition use-cases. To be reasonably useful, the desire was
        for it to support 20Mbytes/sec of data or more. It does achieve
        this, but it is for further study to find higher speed
        methods.\*
    -   This is not such a bad idea, because in future the ADC could be
        swapped out to a (say) 10-bit ADC with no code change on the
        PRU.\*
    -   Once the data has been captured (2000 samples in this example),
        the command byte is acknowledged, so that the Linux hosted
        application can know that the PRU has completed. The PRU now
        sits and waits for a new instruction from the Linux hosted
        application.\* \* -&gt; works for us - fixed depth = fixed \# of
        samples
-   Buffer to be used : detailed at
    http://www.element14.com/community/community/designcenter/single-board-computers/next-gen\_beaglebone//blog/2013/08/04/bbb--high-speed-data-acquisition-and-web-based-ui
    -   ''These were extremely important for two reasons. One reason is
        that the pins to the BBB that I wished to use need to be
        isolated during power-up, because they are used for selecting
        the boot method. If there was any unusual level on the pins upon
        power-up then the BBB will not boot from the eMMC. So, a
        tri-state buffer is needed. The other reason is that there is a
        fair bit of capacitance and it is highly likely that the ADC may
        not be able to directly drive the pins at high speed. I actually
        came across this problem while trying to connect a camera to
        the BBB. I struggled for days without realising that the camera
        could not support the load. So, the buffers are likely to be
        essential for most designs using the pins that were selected. I
        used a 74LVC244A device as a buffer. Note that the clock also
        needs a buffer, unless significant jitter is acceptable. No
        tri-state is required here, so I used a MC74VHC1GT50.
