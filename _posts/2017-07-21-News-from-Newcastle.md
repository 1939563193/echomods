-   [New article from Neasham -
    PDF](/include/biblio/10.1109@TBCAS.2017.2695240.pdf) -- some sources
    for good references
-   Tech insights: using a 12Msps ADC for a 4MHz piezo and a 4 FPS -
    software limited, using a Voice Coil Motor (VCM -- see "Design and
    optimization of a voice coil motor with a rotary actuator for an
    ultrasound scanner," by same author ) for low noise, 15cm deep, 200
    lines over 50Â°, 96V pulses, using synthetic aperture focusing on sig
    proc -- and they have already been doing in FDA compliant in vivo
    testing, Table III shows tech specs achieved.
-   Also introduces some *"low-cost devices recently entering the market
    include the Interson SeeMore probe, the SunBright SUN-806F and the
    Telemed MicrUs, which can be purchased between \$1.5k and \$3k."*.
