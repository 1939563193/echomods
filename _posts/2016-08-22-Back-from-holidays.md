-   Working with Virginie and Benoit to get images
-   Got to play with a [general multi tissue
    fantom](/include/20160812/20160822-Fantom.md): got an image from a
    ATL3 probe, of the fantom.
-   What about [using Kaggle as a data
    repo](http://blog.kaggle.com/2016/08/17/making-kaggle-the-home-of-open-data/)
    for open data ?
