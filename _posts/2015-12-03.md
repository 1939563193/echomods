-   New ADCs in mind ADS803E LTC2315-12
-   Orange Pi Plus 2 : A nasty little thing
-   BBB as always coming mostly from element14 Some limits - not
    exploiting all ?

    SPI speed with BBB :
    http://fr.mathworks.com/help/supportpkg/beagleboneio/ug/use-the-beaglebone-black-spi-interface-to-connect-to-a-device.html
    (up to 32MHz) - which is
-   16 bits : is it possible to set all 16 pins on pru0 as inputs? I saw
    you mentioned something about disabling the microSD functionality on
    the BB to get access to all 16 pins, but I wasn't exactly sure how.
    -- heartofasquid I thought the PRUs had a 16bit parallel capture
    mode or are all the pins not available on the BBB? (need to consult
    the docs) section 4.5.2.2.3.2 of the tech ref spruh73c.pdf One
    thought I had was to use both PRUs to capture alternate bytes/words
    but that was just a thought, again are all the pins available? I'd
    made a mistake, it looks like all of PRU0's GPI pins may be
    available, if we are happy to lose the microSD (no big loss - there
    are other ways to get data in/out of the BBB). So, we can
    theoretically get high-res captures up to about 15bits, if we need 1
    pin for the clock.
