title: 2017-02-19 Update to Doj and such

---


-   Thinking about an update for a neat, silkcreened, well designed
    motherboard. Would be excellent for Altay, Felix and maybe
-   Been doing some progress about the HV - working with Lorena to get
    one on board. I'll have 2 pulsers, will ask for 3. In total I'll
    still be able to send to (Afreen/Felix/Altay) + one for the GroupGet
    friends. Would leave me with one.
-   Afreen still working on the feather, after contacting the PRUDAQ
    guys.
-   Get Felix on Slack?
-   Call scheduled with Fouad on tuesday
-   Making progress on 20e214 - control of the probe OK. Display
    remaining, then CSV saving.
-   Taking more time about the Slack bot: lower priority
-   Update by Tobey: he found a way to compare PDFs.
