Nice reading =)

-   Basecamp outlines their goals -- which they say have always been the
    same -- on their website:
-   Have fun
-   Do exceptional work
-   Build the best product in the business
-   Experiment
-   Pay attention to the details
-   Treat people right
-   Tell the truth
-   Have a positive impact on the world around us
-   Give back
-   Keep learning.
-   "We’re also big believers in business 101. We don’t spend more than
    we earn, we don’t waste money on things that don’t matter, we don’t
    give away everything for free and hope we’ll figure it out before we
    run out of cash. We’re in business to stay in business, and we have
    15 profitable years in a row to back it up."
