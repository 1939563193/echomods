-   Got motherboard design. Forgot VGA. Need 5 pins (H/V/R/G/B). 68R for
    H&V, RGB at 470R if different channels. 180R if all three are
    connected. [ref](https://www.gammon.com.au/forum/?id=11608). Pins
    from: PCM1,2,3.
-   640\*480 -&gt; 128 us = 512 (4px per us) x 256 (8bits). Rest is fun.
-   DB15 socket
-   DEBUG 24MHz8ch -&gt; device is fx2lafw. Pulseview working.
