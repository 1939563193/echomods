title: 2017-09-30 Some experiment

---


-   Done the tests for the pulser ( 20170930a )
-   Some additional works for the motor control
-   @cld a better bilevel control (4 NOPs period -&gt; PPon, Poff, PNon,
    PNoff)
-   @cld float pins between shots? -&gt; work session on
    [bilevel.c](/retired/alt.tbo/test/bilevel.c)
-   @cld pass license to CC-BY-SA

-   @done add some new articles to the new article (all put to bibtex)

-   Some interesting read .. again: 10.1109/ULTSYM.2013.0142 for
