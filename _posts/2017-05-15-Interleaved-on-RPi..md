-   Still about the [RPi0 high-speed
    ADC](https://github.com/kelu124/bomanz/) : if I can't get above
    10Msps due to a memory copy time, I may be able to double the speed
    by having 2 ADCs interleaved... it's to test!
-   Some answers for the CMUT stuff.. let's see if it's going somewhere
    !
-   ATL probes connectors are LEMO 18 or 19 pin.
