-   Done some tests with a breadboard phantom: [read more
    here](/retired/croaker/data/20161217/20161217-TestingArduinoAndPhantom.md).
-   Still moving in the new flat, getting accustomed to the new job..
    and still need to sort the hacking tools in a limited space in the
    new flat =)
-   Interesting competition : Clarius got its approval. Also noted the
    SONON 300C.
-   Having fun with mapping a community using slack. On another repo.
-   Published some update on the ML.
