title: 2016-02-13 Release of Gob

---


-   Lots under way..

-   -   -   Required\* \* : we need to sit with electronics experts to
            check how Murgen, Tobo, Goblin, and Mira can merge - for a
            modular board - ideally as easy as possible to use!

-   IDEA: capelec!
-   Need also to push Goblin's files on the repo. Those are made with
    Eagle, not Altium, so a bit less options, but still interesting to
    see how to work with those files =)
