---


Got some [amazing responses to the post on
HN](https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=14869138), held the 1st pos for
an hour +, got over 200 ups, that's quite enough =) I guess I'm coming
close to an end on this project, and my target would be to try and have
a presentable project before Year 2. The key milestones:

-   I have sold 10 **kits** so far, have ordered 5 sets more to a
    CN PCBA. Will sell those - and let people choose what they want when
    they'll want to play with those. I guess I'll have the community
    Milestone reached when someone provide a significant improvement /
    publishes thanks to this kit. *Status: 50%*. Bonus point if a
    unreached continent so far is involved.
-   **Money**: thanks to the small margin on kits, and hackaday prizes,
    i'm quite [cash neutral](/include/Finance.md) as of today. Having
    the 5 kits sold would permit financing the acquisition of the
    unmantled CN probe. *Status: 100%*
-   Raspberry HAT: I wanted to have a **ultrasound hat** done. I now
    have this ADC pHAT done, which can be perfected, but it's quite a
    win, so a simple 80V monopolar ultrasound board (independant from
    the motor / multiplexer) could be reached by Nov. *Status: 0%*
-   **CN probe** has to be gone if I keep the CN board. Will have to
    trade / leboncoin / ebay it. *Status: 0%*
-   There are a couple of notes here, I'd love to see all of those
    gathered / processed / put into a braindump. Gitbook is good enough,
    but lack structure for raw knowledge dump.
-   I'd be keen on having a 8 to 16 elements module prepared, just so to
    prepare the next gen and passing over of the project. Jan and Ivan
    to support. *Status: 0%*

Nice to have:

-   A slack bot? It would be fun to have a supporting bot to answer
    queries, like "where are the elements benchmarked, how do you
    process dicom, ..."
