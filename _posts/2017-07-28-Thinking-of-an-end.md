---


Got some [amazing responses to the post on
HN](https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=14869138), held the 1st pos for
an hour +, got over 200 ups, that's quite enough =) I guess I'm coming
close to an end on this project, and my target would be to try and have
a presentable project before Year 2. The five key milestones:

1.  **Outreach**: I have sold 10 kits so far, have ordered 5 sets more
    to a CN PCBA. Will sell those - and let people choose what they want
    when they'll want to play with those. I guess I'll have the
    community Milestone reached when someone provide a significant
    improvement / publishes thanks to this kit. *Status: 50%*. Bonus
    point if a unreached continent so far is involved.
2.  ENDOFYEAR: 15 kits sold, CN not good, MF ongoing (20171217)
3.  **Money**: thanks to the small margin on kits, and hackaday prizes,
    i'm quite [cash neutral](/include/Finance.md) as of today. Having
    the 5 kits sold would permit financing the acquisition of the
    unmantled CN probe. *Status: 100%* Bonus: trade the chinese probe on
    leboncoin / ebay. *Status: 0%*
4.  ENDOFYEAR: still waiting (20171217)
5.  **Product**: I wanted to have a **ultrasound hat** done. I now have
    this ADC pHAT done, which can be perfected, but it's quite a win, so
    a simple 80V monopolar ultrasound board (independant from the motor
    / multiplexer) could be reached by Nov. *Status: 0%* Update: could
    be good to use the [probe head](/loftus/) to do a full portable
    probe =)
6.  ENDOFYEAR: Ongoing with Matty (20171217)
7.  **Documentation**: There are a couple of notes here, I'd love to see
    all of those gathered / processed / put into a braindump. Gitbook is
    good enough, but lack structure for raw knowledge dump. TODOS
    include:
8.  Listing all docs under YYYYMMDD
9.  ENDOFYEAR: Quite happy, having added experiments (20171217)
10. **Future** I'd be keen on having a 8 to 16 elements module prepared,
    just so to prepare the next gen and passing over of the project. Jan
    and Ivan to support. *Status: 0%* Muxing using ATTINY85 ?
11. ENDOFYEAR: Shifting to chaotic masks ;) (20171217)

Nice to have:

-   A slack bot? It would be fun to have a supporting bot to answer
    queries, like "where are the elements benchmarked, how do you
    process dicom, ..."
