title: 2016-11-15 Some lag, new job

---


Just started a new job 10 days back, so I lagged a bit. However, some
news!

-   Sold two boards so far on
    [tindie](https://www.tindie.com/products/kelu124/ultrasound-imaging-analog-processing-module/) -
    which also gave opportunities to discuss with people: awesome.
-   Lent a [emulator module](/silent/) to echOpen for their testing, and
    updated doc.
-   Auto documentation moved forward! Plenty of new debug options in the
    [doc generation journal](/doc/log.md)
-   Some metadata on md files on board
-   Trying to get 2 probes on ebay for testing purposes
-   Some forum at
    -   https://forum.arduino.cc/index.php?topic=79285.new\#new
    -   http://forum.arduino.cc/index.php?topic=177489.0
-   Posted something on reddit as well:
