title: 2016-02-26 More about shorts

---


-   Further tests. Shortage still exists.
-   Short is not on the PCB. Appears after solder.
-   Found that the RECOM component was designed to be upside down --
    need to resolder it. Luckily it was a via component.
-   This would not be the source of the short anyhow.
-   EF recommends that we burn 10A on the 5V plane to see which
    component would burn.. hmm i'm quite shy to do this :p
-   Documenting the issue on github.
-   Sending back boards to EF.
