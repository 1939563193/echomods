title: 2016-07-06 Making progress with EMW3165

---


-   With the help of Igor, preparing a UDP server of EMW3165 and getting
    a throughput of 9Mbit/s on average.
-   Getting one of the modules
-   Requesting Nicolas' help on getting HV7360LA (fab's suppliers are
    lost)
-   Thinking of the overall structure of the maker kit. I need a wooden
    box and an aquarium (plexiglass, glue = solvent cement)
-   Review of the HAD budget (probe, transducer, fab, et al?). Some
    euros may be saved.
