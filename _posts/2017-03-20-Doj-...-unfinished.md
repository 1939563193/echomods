title: 2017-03-20 Doj ... unfinished

---


-   Indeed. Forgot to add a ADC input directly from a strip, two strips
    for PulseOn and PulseOff, and a way to control the servo from the
    Pi.
-   Also starting the new season of the HackadayPrize =)
-   Still some issues with [bomanz (on
    HAD)](https://hackaday.io/project/20455-20msps-adc-raspberrypi-extension-bomanz)
    PCB. Some pads suck. I guess I'll order the board from OSHPark along
    with [Doj's](/doj/) and solder all these tiny stuff. Not so many
    actually.
